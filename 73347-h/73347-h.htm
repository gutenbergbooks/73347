Longmans.</p>
</div>

<p class='c009'>It is one of the most singular
features of our institutions that,
when our diplomatic relations with
remote and semi-barbarous countries
become so involved that even
the Government is at a loss to know
what course to pursue, the public take
up the question in a confident off-hand
way; and though, by the force
of circumstances, deprived of the information
possessed by the Foreign
Office, they do not hesitate either to
denounce or to approve the policy
recommended by those who have
studied the subject on the spot, and
who alone can be competent to form
an opinion on the matter. It is
true that papers are occasionally laid
before Parliament, but what proportion
of those who hold such decided
views have read them? In
the case of the Arrow, when
people voted for peace or war with
China, how many members of Parliament
had informed themselves
on the merits of the question? and
what did their constituents know
about it? Yet so it is; the ultimate
decision upon all important
and complicated questions of foreign
policy necessarily rests with the
most ill-informed class. If they
generally decide wrong, we must
console ourselves by the consideration
that even free institutions have
their drawbacks, but in compensation
have made us so rich and
powerful, that we can always scramble
out of any scrape they may get
us into. In countries despotically
governed, the merits of a secret
diplomacy are inestimable; but
where the Government is responsible,
though it would be difficult
to substitute an open system, secret
diplomacy is attended with grave
inconveniences, for it becomes impossible
to furnish that public who
sit, as it were, in appeal, with the
whole facts of the case upon which
they are called to decide. It is
then clearly the interest of the
Foreign Office to encourage the
dissemination of accurate political
information in a popular form, when
the publication of it does not involve
a breach of confidence; and
inasmuch as Blue-Books are not
generally considered light or agreeable
reading, and are somewhat inaccessible,
the diplomatist who has
a political story to tell, and can do
it without betraying State secrets,
is a public benefactor. In these
days of official responsibility, it is
not only due to the public but to
himself that he should have an
opportunity of stating his case. It
may happen that his conduct will
be brought publicly in question and
decided upon before he has an opportunity
of laying before the world
all the facts. Great injustice is
frequently done to officials serving
in distant parts of the world, who
even at last are unable to remove
the erroneous impressions formed
upon incorrect or insufficient information.
This has been specially
the case in China and the East: a
policy based upon an acquaintance
with the local conditions as intimate
as it was possible for a foreigner
to obtain, has been upset by
a majority of ignorant legislators,
who too often receive their impressions
from superficial travellers, or
residents with special interests at
stake. It is clear that the opinion
of a merchant is not so likely to
be right in diplomatic questions as
that of a trained official, who has
passed half his life in studying the
language, institutions, and people
of the country to which he has
been accredited; yet when it comes
to be a question between the mercantile
community and the minister,
the latter is in danger of going to
the wall.</p>

<p class='c009'>While, on the one hand, the
traditions of the Foreign Office are
opposed to what may be termed
diplomatic literature—and they dole
out their own information with a
somewhat niggard hand—the British
community resident in the East,
hampered by no such restraints,
and aided by a scurrilous press, may
prejudice the public mind at home
to such an extent that no subsequent
defence is of much avail. We
cannot wonder then, if, after five-and-twenty
years’ experience of
China and Japan, Sir Rutherford
Alcock should take the opportunity
of giving a full, true, and particular
statement of the political difficulties
by which he is surrounded, in anticipation
of a crisis which he sees impending,
which no diplomacy will
be able to avert, but in which he
will on his return probably find
himself involved.</p>

<p class='c010'>“By whatever measures,” he remarks,
“of a coercive nature, we might seek to
attain this object” (the execution of the
Treaty in all its stipulations), “it should
be clearly seen that there is war in the
background, more or less near, but tolerably
certain sooner or later to come.
During the last two years, whatever a
conciliatory spirit could suggest, with
temper, patience, and forbearance in all
things, had been tried. Diplomacy had
wellnigh exhausted its resources to induce
the Japanese Government to take
a different view of its interests, and to
act in accordance with the spirit of the
treaties entered into. Little more remained
to be tried in this direction, nor
could much hope be entertained that
better success would follow a longer persistence
in the same course.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The nature of our political relations
with Japan is such, that a
history of three years’ diplomacy in
that country is not attended with
the inconveniences which would be
incidental to a similar narrative
from a European court. Our relations
with other friendly nations
are in no way involved, and there
can be no objection to such a work
as that now before us, even in a
red-tape point of view. Still, we
are not aware of a work of this
kind, from the pen of a minister
actually at his post, ever having
appeared; and although our author
gives us a most detailed and graphic
account of the moral and social
state of Japan, it is the record of
his diplomatic relations with the
Government of the Tycoon that we
regard as being at once the most
novel and interesting feature of his
book.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I should probably have hesitated,”
says Sir Rutherford in his preface, “had
it not seemed important to furnish materials
for a right judgment in matters of
national concern connected with Japan,
and our relations there, while it might
yet be time to avert, by the intelligent
appreciation of our true situation, grievous
disappointment, as well as increased
complications and calamities. A free
expression of opinion in matters of
public interest is not to be lightly adventured
upon, however, and in many
cases those holding office are altogether
precluded from such action. At the same
time, much mischief is often done by
undue reticence in matters which must,
in a country like ours, be the subject of
public discussion. It so happened that
I was relieved from any difficulty on this
head by the publication <em>in extenso</em> of the
greater number of my despatches, which
were printed and laid before Parliament.
And not only was the necessity for
silence obviated by such publication in
this country, but a similar course was
followed at Washington in respect of the
despatches of my colleague, the American
Minister, during the same period.
As in each of these series there is a very
unreserved expression of opinion as to
the political situation of the country, the
action of the Japanese authorities, the
views entertained by colleagues, and
the conduct of the foreign communities,
the decision of the respective Governments
of both countries to make the
despatches public, and this so freely as
to leave little of a confidential character
unprinted, effectually removed all the
impediments which might otherwise
have existed.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The general reader must not suppose,
however, that because politics
engage a large share of the work
before us, he will, on that account,
find it dull. Japan is probably the
only country in the world in which
diplomacy becomes a pursuit of
thrilling excitement. Sometimes
it leads to some curious discovery,
and reveals to us some part of the
political machinery in the government
of the country heretofore unsuspected
and unknown. Sometimes
it furnishes amusing illustrations
of the Japanese mode of
diplomatic fencing; at others, it
involves a frightful tragedy or a
quaint official ceremony. Without
these details to illustrate each phase
through which our political relations
have passed, we should never have
been able to realise the difficulties
with which our officials in those
remote regions have to contend, or
the nature of the opposition persistently
offered by the Japanese Government.</p>

<p class='c009'>The task of permanently installing
for the first time a legation in
a city of upwards of two millions
of people having been safely accomplished,
Mr Alcock entered upon
his first diplomatic struggle, the
point of which was merely to fix a
day for the purpose of exchanging
the ratifications of Lord Elgin’s
Treaty. The discussion preliminary
to this formality occupied no less
than seven days. At last the details
are arranged, and it is decided
that the Treaty is to be carried in
procession through the city, under
a canopy ornamented with flags
and evergreens, surrounded by a
guard of marines, and followed by
fifty blue-jackets; Captain Hand,
with a large number of his officers
in uniform and on horseback, following
immediately after the four
petty officers carrying the Treaty.
We can well imagine the effect
which so novel a procession was
likely to produce upon the inhabitants
of Yedo. When the formalities
were accomplished, “signals,
arranged by the Japanese in advance
(by fans from street to street)
conveyed the news to the Sampson
with telegraphic speed in a minute
and a half, a distance of six miles.”
So our Minister hoists his flag, and
settles himself down in solitary
grandeur, to pass his life of exile in
solving the difficult problem of reconciling
the civilisation he represents
with that which surrounds
him, but which the jealousy of the
Government will not permit him
to investigate. This does not, however,
prevent our author from entering
upon lengthy and interesting
philosophical disquisitions upon the
many moral, social, and political
questions which must, under such
circumstances, present themselves
to a thoughtful mind. He has not
been six weeks so employed when
he is suddenly roused from his
speculations by a tragical event
which occurs at Yokuhama. As
this is the first of a series of exciting
incidents, we will give our
readers an epitome of those which
occurred during three years, and
the particulars of which are detailed
at length in various parts of the
book:—</p>

<p class='c010'>“A Russian officer, with a sailor and
a steward, were suddenly set upon in
the principal street by some armed
Japanese, and hewn down with the most
ghastly wounds that could be inflicted.
The sailor was cleft through his skull to
the nostrils—half the scalp sliced down,
and one arm nearly severed from the
shoulder through the joint. The officer
was equally mangled, his lungs protruding
from a sabre-gash across the body;
the thighs and legs deeply gashed.”</p>

<p class='c008'>In the succeeding tragedies the
wounds are invariably of the above
savage nature, but we will not always
inflict upon our readers a full
description of the horrible details.</p>

<p class='c009'>Two months after this the servant
of the French Consul is cut
to pieces in the street—cause unknown.
By way of varying the
excitement, the Tycoon’s palace is
burnt down about the same time,
and the Japanese Ministers propose
to stop all business in consequence.
This is of course not considered a
legitimate way of evading disagreeable
questions. Diplomatic difficulties
continue to be discussed, and
the greater part of the settlement
of Yokuhama is burnt down:—</p>

<p class='c010'>“While yet occupied by these events,
we were startled by another of more immediate
and personal import. It was
near midnight; Mr Eusden, the Japanese
secretary, was standing by my side, when
the longest and most violent shock of
an earthquake yet experienced since our
arrival brought every one to his feet with
a sudden impulse to fly from under the
shaking roof. It began at first very
gently, but rapidly increased in the
violence of the vibrations until the
earth seemed to rock under our feet,
and to be heaved up by some mighty
explosive powder in the caldrons beneath.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The nerves of our author scarcely
recover from the shock of the earthquake
when they receive another
of a different description. A hasty
step is heard outside his room, and
“Captain Marten, of H.M.S. Roebuck,
threw back the sliding-panel.
‘Come quickly; your linguist is
being carried in badly wounded.’
My heart misgave me that his
death-knell had struck.” Of course
it had; they seldom miss their
stroke in Japan. “The point” (of
the sword) “had entered at his back
and came out above the right breast;
and, thus buried in his body, the
assassin left it, and disappeared as
stealthily as he came.” While discussing
this matter, in dashes the
whole French Legation—the French
Consul-General at the head: “‘Nous
voici! nous venons vous demander
de l’hospitalité—l’incendie nous a
atteint.’ Then follows Monsieur
l’Abbé in a dressing-gown—a glass
thermometer in one hand, and a
breviary in the other; then the
Chancellor in slippers, with a revolver
and a <i><span lang="fr">bonnet de nuit</span></i>.”
What with an assassination in one
Legation and a fire in another on
the same night, our diplomatists
have their hands full. Our author,
however, seems to have passed a
few nights in comparative tranquillity
after this, before he is again
roused at four o’clock in the morning
by the arrival of an express from
Kanagawa with the news that about
eight o’clock in the evening two
Dutch captains had been slain in
the main street of Yokuhama—“a
repetition, in all its leading circumstances
and unprovoked barbarity,
of the assassination perpetrated on
the Russians.” After this, beyond
a few bad earthquakes, nothing
happens for a month or so, “when,
on my return from a visit to Kanagawa,
the first news that greeted
me as I entered the Legation was of
so startling and incredible a character
that I hesitated to believe
what was told me. The Gotairo or
Regent was said to have been assassinated
in broad daylight on his
way to the palace, and this, too, in
the very midst of a large retinue of
his retainers!” The account, which
our author gives at length, of this
occurrence, and of the causes which
led to it, is most characteristic: we
have only space for the result:—</p>

<p class='c010'>“Eight of the assailants were unaccounted
for when all was over, and many of
the retinue were stretched on the ground,
wounded and dying, by the side of those
who had made the murderous onslaught.
The remnant of the Regent’s people, released
from their deadly struggle, turned
to the norimon to see how it had fared
with their master in the brief interval,
to find only a headless trunk: the bleeding
trophy carried away was supposed
to have been the head of the Gotairo
himself, hacked off on the spot. But,
strangest of all these startling incidents,
it is further related that <em>two</em> heads were
found missing, and that which was in
the fugitive’s hand was only a lure to
the pursuing party, while the true trophy
had been secreted on the person of another,
and was thus successfully carried
off, though the decoy paid the penalty
of his life.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The head of the Regent is said
to have been got safely out of Yedo,
and presented to the Prince,
who was his enemy, and who spat
upon it with maledictions. It was
reported afterwards to have been
exposed in the public execution-ground
of the spiritual capital, with
a placard over it, on which was the
following inscription: “This is the
head of a traitor, who has violated
the most sacred laws of Japan—those
which forbid the admission
of foreigners into the country.”
After this, with the exception of a
“murderous onslaught made by a
drunken Yaconin on an English
merchant at Hakodadi,” there is
another lull, varied only by putting
the Legations in a state of defence.
They “were filled with Japanese
troops, field-pieces were placed in
the courtyards of the several Legations,
and the ministers were urgently
requested to abstain from
going outside!” A month passes,
and life is absolutely becoming monotonous,
from the absence of the
usual stimulant in the shape either
of a fire, a murder, or a good earthquake,
when there suddenly appeared,
“as we were sitting down
to dinner one evening, the Abbé
Gérard, pale and agitated, bringing
with him, in a norimon, M. de Bellecourt’s
Italian servant, who had
been attacked, while quietly standing
at the gate of the French Legation,
by two Samourai (daimios’ retainers)
passing at the moment, and
by one of whom he had been severely
wounded.”</p>

<p class='c009'>A strong digestion must be essential
to the comfort of the diplomatist
in Japan, for “next month, a few
minutes before the dinner-hour,
there was a rushing and scuffling
of many feet along the passages,
the noise of which reached me in
my dressing-room, at the extremity
of the building, and presently, high
above all, came the ominous cry of
‘Cadjee!’ (fire).” The Legation was
nearly burnt to the ground, but
the Japanese servants behaved well,
and ultimately succeeded in extinguishing
the flames. We will not
recount, in our list of excitements,
all the escapes from murderous Yaconins
and disagreeable rencontres
which are recorded, though they
would satisfy any moderate craving
for “sensations;” and passing rapidly
by, as not worthy of notice,
the case of an Englishman who shot
a Japanese (and for having punished
whom Mr Alcock was afterwards
fined at Hong-Kong), come at once
to the night of the 14th of January,
“when, about ten o’clock, I
received a brief note from Mr Harris,
asking me to send surgical aid
to Mr Heuskin, who had been
brought in wounded.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Mr Heuskin was the secretary of
the American Legation—a man universally
liked, and a most able public
servant. He had received a
frightful gash across the abdomen,
which proved fatal, besides other
thrusts and cuts of less moment.
His funeral was attended by all the
members of the different Legations,
at the risk, however, of their lives.
About this time, says our author,
“an event occurred calculated to
give greater significance to the
numerous sinister rumours afloat.
Hori Oribeno Kami, the most intelligent,
experienced, and respected
of the governors of foreign affairs—the
one best versed in European
business, and the most reasonable
and conciliatory of his class—disappeared
from the scene.” In other
words, he had ripped himself up.
The writer of this article, who had
formerly been well acquainted with
this minister, happening to arrive
in Japan shortly after his death, received
from the Dutch Consul the
following account of the event:—That
gentleman had called on Hori
Oribeno Kami one day, had found
him in rather low spirits, and, on inquiring
the cause, was informed by
the fated minister that he was about
to put an end to himself on the
following day; that he had already
issued his invitation-cards for the
banquet at which the ceremony
was to take place; and, further,
expressed his regret that the custom
of the country limited the invitation
to his relations and most
intimate friends, and that he was
thus deprived of the pleasure of
requesting the company of his visitor
to partake of the meal which
was destined to terminate in so
tragic a manner.</p>

<p class='c009'>The foreign Legations after this
come to the conclusion that life at
Yedo is attended by too many anxieties,
and retire to Yokuhama till the
Government should promise to make
things safer and more comfortable.
This they ultimately pledge themselves
to do. Our author has occasion
shortly after to make a long
overland journey through the country,
and on the night of his return
to Yedo the Legation is attacked
by a band of assassins, who severely
wound Messrs Oliphant and Morrison,
and very nearly murder everybody.
Some idea of the nature of
that midnight struggle may be
formed from the following list of
persons killed and wounded in the
passages and garden of the Legation:—</p>

</table>

<p class='c009'>With reference to the fate of
these assailants, the following extract
from a letter from Mr Alcock
to Earl Russell appears in the papers
just laid before Parliament:—</p>

<p class='c010'>“The Ministers have since informed
me that three more of the assailants
on the night of the 5th July have been
arrested in Prince Mito’s territories,
and will be proceeded against; also
that the only survivor in the recent
attack on the Foreign Minister has confessed
that some of the party were men
engaged in the attack on the Legation.
If so—and only fourteen were actually
engaged (which has always seemed to
me doubtful)—they will have pretty well
accounted for the whole number: Three
having been killed on the spot; three
taken prisoners and since executed;
two committed suicide; three more lately
arrested; three supposed to have
been killed in the recent attack on the
Foreign Minister. Total, fourteen.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The following paper found on the
body of one of the assailants gives
the reasons of the band for making
the attempt:—</p>

<p class='c010'>“I, though I am a person of low
standing, have not patience to stand by
and see the sacred empire defiled by
the foreigner. This time I have determined
in my heart to undertake to follow
out my master’s will. Though,
being altogether humble myself, I cannot
make the might of the country to
shine in foreign nations, yet with a
little faith, and a little warrior’s power,
I wish in my heart separately (by myself),
though I am a person of low degree,
to bestow upon my country one
out of a great many benefits. If this
thing from time to time may cause the
foreigner to retire, and partly tranquillise
both the minds of the Mikado and the
Tycoon (or the manes of departed Mikados
and Tycoons), I shall take to
myself the highest praise. Regardless
of my own life, I am determined to set
out.”</p>

<p class='c013'>[Here follow the fourteen signatures.]</p>

<p class='c008'>It must be admitted that the
Lonins, as the bravos are called,
choose their victims with great impartiality
as to rank and nationality;
they murder servants and ministers,
both Japanese and foreign, as the
fancy seizes them. A few days after
the massacre at the Legation, two
of the Japanese Ministers were attacked,
but their retinue beat off
their assailants: after this nothing
particular happened for some time,
except that the Governor of Yedo
had to rip himself up “for having
offended by intruding his opinion
at a grand council of the daimios
(he not being a daimio).” Meantime
the Government offer to build
a fortified Legation, and Sir Rutherford
moves his habitation temporarily
down to Yokuhama: the
hostile class seem more determined
than ever to carry their point, as
we may gather from the following
letter left by four of his retainers
at the house of their master, the
Prince of Mito, whose service they
leave to become outlaws:—</p>

<p class='c010'>“We become lonins now, since the
foreigner gains more and more influence
in the country, unable to see the ancient
law of Gongen Sama violated. We become
all four lonins, with the intention
of compelling the foreigners to depart.”</p>

<p class='c013'>[Here follow the four signatures.]</p>

<p class='c008'>Shortly after this, Sir Rutherford,
who has been dining down
at Yokuhama with M. de Bellecourt,
receives the news at ten
o’clock at night, that Ando Tsusimano
Kami, the second Minister
of Foreign Affairs, and the one supposed
to be most favourable to the
maintenance of foreign relations,
had been attacked as he was on his
way to the palace.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Ando, it appears, instantly divined
that he was to be attacked, and, throwing
himself out of the norimon, drew his
sword to defend himself. It was well
he lost no time, for already his people
were being cut down by the desperate
band of assassins. The next instant he
received a sabre-cut across the face and
a spear-thrust in the side that had wellnigh
proved fatal. As in the previous
case of the Regent, the life-and-death
struggle was brief as it was bloody. In
a few seconds seven of the assailants
lay stretched, wounded or dead, on the
ground, and only one (the eighth) escaped.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The Minister himself, after lingering
for some time between life
and death, finally recovered. While
our author is listening to these details
there is an alarm of fire, and
he spends the rest of the night in
putting it out.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It lasted several hours, and a large
block of houses was destroyed. The
danger of its spreading over the whole
settlement was at one time very great;
and that which made the event more
serious was the fact of some men
dressed like the Japanese police having
been discovered by Lieutenant Aplin at
the commencement actively engaged in
spreading the fire to an adjoining
house.”</p>

<p class='c008'>This is about the last of our
author’s list of sensations; but in
order to complete the thrilling category
we will take a leaf or two out
of the Blue-Book of his successor,
Colonel Neale, who is appointed to
the charge of the Legation during Sir
Rutherford’s absence. No sooner
does he arrive there than he proceeds
to test the charms of a residence at
Yedo. A few days after his arrival
he writes as follows to his French
colleague, whose three years’ experience
has taught him not to move
out of Yokuhama unnecessarily:—</p>

<p class='c010'>“<span class='sc'>Sir</span>,—It is with deep regret I have
to acquaint you that this Legation has
passed through the ordeal of another
murderous assault on the part of Japanese
assassins. About midnight last
night, the sentry at my bedroom door
was suddenly attacked and desperately
wounded, his life being despaired of.
The corporal going his rounds at the
same moment was murderously assailed
a short distance off; but he managed to
reach my door, and there he fell and
died. His body was conveyed into the
room in which we were assembled, and
was found to have received no less than
sixteen desperate sword and lance wounds.
The wounded sentry was also on the floor
of the room, dying fast from nine
wounds. This man, by name Charles
Sweet, died the following morning.”</p>

<p class='c008'>After this, Colonel Neale thinks
Yedo disagreeable as a permanent
residence, and retires to Yokuhama;
but, to judge by a letter he writes
to Lord Russell a month afterwards,
he does not seem to have improved
his position:—</p>

<p class='c010'>“<span class='sc'>My Lord</span>,—It becomes my painful
duty once more to lay before your Lordship
the details of the barbarous murder
of another British subject, Mr C.
L. Richardson, a merchant residing at
Yokuhama, and the desperate wounding
of two other merchants, Mr W. Marshall
and Mr W. C. Clarke, both of Yokuhama;
the latter gentleman is likely to
lose his arm. Mr Richardson, nearly cut
to pieces, fell from his horse; and while
lying in a dying state, one of the high
officials of the cortege, borne in a chair,
is stated to have told his followers to
cut the throat of the unfortunate gentleman.
The lady (Mrs Borradaile), though
cut at herself, miraculously escaped unwounded;
never drawing rein, and in an
exhausted and fainting state, she reached
Yokuhama. The body of Mr Richardson
was afterwards found, and brought
here for interment.”</p>

<p class='c008'>And so for the present ends the
bloody story: we have condensed it
as much as possible, both for the
reader’s sake and our own; but, considering
the important interests we
have at stake in Japan, we have felt
it our duty to do all in our power
to induce people to read the work
before us. After they have gratified
that morbid craving for excitement
which seems to be the literary taste
of the day, they may perhaps be
induced seriously to think what is
to be done under the circumstances.
We have not recounted the efforts
which our diplomatic agents in
Japan have made to obtain redress,
nor the success which has attended
those efforts. They are to be found
detailed at some length in the work
before us. If the reader will take
the trouble carefully to read Sir
Rutherford’s account of the administrative
system of Japan, and
more especially of the feudal nobility,
of the influence they exercise,
and the material forces they
control, he will perhaps be able to
form some idea for himself of the
best course to be pursued. If he
makes up his mind—as he probably
has done—on what he has read in
this article, he will come to a totally
wrong conclusion. We did not give
him a list of horrors in order that he
might get up and say dogmatically,
“Oh, it’s clear the Japanese don’t
want us, and we ought never to
have gone there; and the best thing
we can do now is to take ourselves
off.” We have only recited these
horrors to lure the superficial politician
into the perusal of a work, the
dry parts of which are the most
important. He will learn in it under
what circumstances we went to
Japan in the first instance—how it
happened that a treaty was as much
forced upon us by circumstances as
upon the Japanese—how we never
compelled them to make one, as is
generally supposed. He will also
find how popular the foreigner is
among the lower and middle classes
of the Japanese, how great is the
aptitude of the mass of the population
for trade, how readily they
enter into commercial pursuits, and
how quickly they adopt the appliances
and inventions of a more
advanced and enlightened civilisation
than their own—how anxious
they are to improve both their intellectual
and material condition.
Then, if he looks at the chapter on
trade, with the statistics it contains,
he will observe how steady is its
development, in spite of the obstructive
policy of the Government, and
how much room there still is for
expansion, what vast resources still
undeveloped the country possesses,
what room for progress in every
branch of art and industry. He
will find nowhere that the Government
deny our right to be in
Japan, or even profess anything
but the most anxious desire to see
the Treaty carried out in all its fulness,
whatever they may secretly
feel on the subject. They constantly
allude to the difficulties they have
to contend with from that one
dangerous class who are opposed
to the foreigner, and who, though
not numerous, are so powerful as
to be dangerous opponents. Every
restriction placed on trade by the
Government, it is professed, arises
only from a desire to gain time
for the conciliation of this class;
and we have so far given the
ministers of the Tycoon credit for
good faith, that we have consented
to postpone the opening of some of
the ports as stipulated by treaty.
Inasmuch, then, as the Japanese
Government voluntarily entered into
treaty-relations with this country;
inasmuch as they profess themselves
anxious to see it carried out,
and conscious of the benefit it is
likely to confer upon the empire;
inasmuch as the great mass of the
population is decidedly in favour
of an extended commercial intercourse
with foreigners; inasmuch
as the present value of the annual
trade with Japan is upwards of a
million sterling, and certain to increase;
inasmuch as a wealthy British
community, consisting of upwards
of three hundred persons, have
already established themselves in
the country, and possess a great deal
of valuable property, in the shape of
buildings, warehouses, and all the
appliances of trade, besides having
large sums of money at stake, which
they have invested on the faith of
a Treaty signed by their own sovereign,
and the abandonment of
which would be a breach of faith,
and entitle them to compensation;
inasmuch, moreover, as the whole of
our commercial interests in China
would be imperilled by a blow so
fatal to our prestige throughout the
East as withdrawal from Japan;—for
all these reasons, we say, the
conclusion so rapidly arrived at by
our “dear reader” may be, after
all, erroneous; and there may be
serious objections to the course he
would propose, even granting that
theoretically he is right in his premises,
and that it would have been
better had we never found ourselves
driven by the Americans
into making a Japanese treaty. It
is possible, nay probable, however,
that we have failed to convince
him, and that, gifted with a prophetic
eye, he replies to us—“Very
well, you will see you will have a
row.” We confess that in this instance
he is right. We do not see
how that is to be avoided. We
think it will turn out a good investment
of money, and not be immoral,
but we admit the fact.</p>

<p class='c009'>Indeed, the Japanese themselves
seem preparing for it, as the following
anecdote, narrated by Sir
Rutherford, will show:—</p>

<p class='c010'>“When I paid a visit to Hakodadi
some months after my arrival, where
there are extensive lead-mines, I asked
the Governor why his Government did
not allow some of the produce to be exported,
suggesting that it might be a
source of national wealth and revenue;
and the reply was characteristic in many
ways. ‘We have none to spare.’ ‘None
to spare!’ I rejoined, in surprise; ‘what
can you use it for? You neither employ
it in building nor utensils.’ ‘We want
it all for <em>ball-practice</em>.’ They did not
choose to export, for reasons not very
easily explained; but they were not
sorry, perhaps, to point to such a use for
<em>home consumption</em>.”</p>

<p class='c008'>We cannot flatter ourselves that
the feudal class will submit tamely
to the inconveniences which the
extension of commercial relations
with foreign countries may entail
upon them. The monopolies they
now enjoy are threatened, their
power and influence will be diminished
in proportion as the mass
of the population is enriched, and
their prestige damaged by the independent
bearing of the foreigner.
Are the interests of the country at
large to be sacrificed to the prejudices
of this class, and are a people
desirous of trade, and anxious to
advance in the arts of civilisation,
to be abandoned because an aristocracy
shrinks from contact with
the stranger? So long as the Government,
whether sincerely or not,
profess their intention of carrying
out the Treaty, and ostensibly manifest
a desire for our presence in the
country, the hostility of a single class
can be no sufficient reason for the
relinquishment of our treaty-rights.
The question is how best to meet
a hostility which places the lives
of our countrymen in danger, and
against which, as it threatens the
members of the Japanese Government
as well as ourselves, they
cannot guarantee us. Hitherto one
great difficulty in chalking out a
policy has been our ignorance of
the complex machinery of Japanese
government. We have never had
an accurate idea of the relations in
which the Temporal and Spiritual
Emperors, the daimios, and the
great Councils of State stand towards
each other. The work before
us throws more light on this most
interesting point than we have yet
received, but still we are groping
for a policy. The excessive reticence
of the Japanese in all matters
connected with their system of internal
administration, and the secrecy
they so religiously observe in
all their communications with foreigners,
combined with their habitual
mendacity, make it impossible
for us to do more than guess at the
best way of meeting the difficulties
as they arise. The longer the
diplomatist resides in the country,
and the more he studies its institutions
and the character of the people
with whom he has to deal, the more
is he puzzled in deciding upon the
best course to adopt. The only
persons who feel no difficulty on
this score are the merchants’ clerks
who have just arrived, and who
love to propound their views in the
local newspapers. There are those
even in this country who profess to
understand how to deal with “Orientals,”
and because, perhaps, they
may have been at Bombay, consider
themselves qualified to lay down
the law upon any question of policy
which may arise between Cairo and
the Sandwich Islands; but it is
only the superficial observer who
classes all Orientals in the same
category; they require as many
different modes of treatment as
“Westerns,” and there is no more
resemblance between a Japanese
and a Tamul than there is between
a Wallachian and a New-Englander.
There is a great danger of such persons
applying some general principle,
which is right in the main, to
all cases, and failing to discover
when the rule demands an exception.
For instance, it is pretty
generally admitted that any concession
to an Oriental government
is considered as a sign of weakness;
therefore, although you may
have burnt down the Summer
Palace of the Emperor of China,
and had Pekin at the mercy of
your armies, bully the Government
of that country into conceding
our exorbitant demands, or they
will think you weak. Such is the
logic of a recent memorial signed
by the mercantile community of
China. Again, in Japan, when the
Tycoon signed a treaty with this
country, his ministers, foreseeing the
difficulties with which they would
have to contend from the opposition
of the aristocracy, stipulated
that the ports should be opened by
degrees, and the commencement of
trade thus assumed the form of
a political experiment. We have
given a list of the bloody results:
the Japanese Government points
to it, and prays that a postponement
for five years may be allowed
in the opening of the other ports,
to avoid the multiplication of
tragedies by the number of ports.
The sum appears a simple one: if
you have twelve murders a year
with three ports open, how many
will you have with six? The mercantile
community demand that the
other three be opened according to
Treaty; any concession will be considered
a sign of weakness. They
may be right in this instance; and
as our diplomatic relations with
Japan are certain not to run smoothly,
it will be always open to them
to say there would have been no
difficulty had we refused the concession.
However that may be,
our Government have given the
Japanese credit for a certain amount
of good faith in the efforts they
have made for our protection, and
are willing to try the effect of time
in softening the asperities of the
hostile class.</p>

<p class='c009'>The most remarkable result which
has yet been produced by the introduction
of the foreigner into Japan
has been the abandonment of Yedo
by the aristocracy. It is impossible
as yet to foresee the consequences
of this movement. The immediate
effect of the exodus of more than
200,000 armed men will be to render
the capital a safer place of residence
for foreigners than it has
been heretofore, although it is probable
that disbanded retainers, or
“lonins” as they are called, may
still haunt the purlieus of the Legation
with the view of carrying
out the policy of their lords in exterminating
the foreigner. The
Japanese Government has built a
fortified Legation on a very defensible
position: this will be surrounded
by a moat and wall, and garrisoned
by a small body of European
soldiers. Except when the members
of the Mission ride out, they
will be comparatively safe, and even
then they will be in no danger of
meeting those processions which
were constantly parading the streets
when the city was inhabited by the
feudal class, and each of which was
composed of hundreds of armed
retainers bitterly hostile to the
foreigner. The ultimate consequences
of this movement it is impossible
to foresee. It may be
that the daimios have determined
to withdraw from any active opposition,
and have retired to sulk in
their own territories; or they may
have left Yedo for the purpose of
organising themselves, with the view
of bringing about a civil war, and
expelling the foreigner by force of
arms. The movement may have
originated among themselves, and
been carried out in defiance of the
Government; or it may have been
suggested by the Government as a
means of relieving them from the
danger and annoyance of further
collisions with the foreigner. The
residence of the daimios at Yedo
was made compulsory upon them
by the celebrated Taiko Sama, who,
after he had reduced the rebellious
aristocracy to submission, devised
this method of keeping them under
surveillance. Every noble was compelled
to keep an establishment at
the capital, partly as a recognition
of the Tycoon as his feudal superior,
partly because those members
of his family who were obliged to
reside there served as hostages for
the good behaviour of the prince.
It may easily be imagined that this
bondage was irksome to so proud a
class, and the present Government
may have released them from it, on
condition of their withdrawing their
opposition to the fulfilment of the
treaties with foreign powers. It
will be seen from the notice we
have already quoted, and which was
signed by four lonins, that an old
law exists, which has never been
repealed, prohibiting the residence
of the foreigner in Japan; this
forms the groundwork of the opposition
policy, and it is believed that
the Spiritual Emperor has expressed
his dissent from the act of its infringement
by the Tycoon.</p>

<p class='c009'>Practically, then, it would seem
that political parties in the empire
are divided into two classes—one
consisting of the Mikado and a large
section of the aristocracy, who do
not consider themselves bound by
treaty-stipulations with foreigners;
the other, consisting of the Tycoon
and his government, who do; and
this latter party, we may conclude,
has the sympathy and support of
the mass of the population. As,
however, the Temporal Government
has proved itself too weak to cope
with the opposition headed by the
Mikado, the question is, how we
can best guarantee the safety of
our countrymen, and extort that
redress which the Government is
powerless to enforce in cases of
violent outrage. Diplomacy is
powerless, for it cannot reach the
offenders; and we are thus driven
into hostile action. Either we
must insist upon the Mikado ratifying
the Treaty, and be prepared
to employ force in case of his refusing
to do so; or we must take
summary vengeance upon any individual
daimio who offends. The
objection to the first course is, that
an application to the Mikado for
a ratification of the Treaty would
imply that it had not been made
with the right person in the first
instance, and therefore was not valid.
We should thus place ourselves in
a false position, for which there is
no necessity, as the Tycoon’s Government
maintain the validity of
the Treaty, and deny that any ratification
on the part of the Mikado
is requisite. On the other hand,
there can be no doubt that the
recognition of the Treaty by the
Mikado would at once put an end
to the opposition of the nobles. In
the event, moreover, of the Mikado
declining to ratify, we should be
compelled to use force. And although,
as Miako, the residence of
the Spiritual Court, is not above
thirty miles from the sea, and may
be approached for part of the way
by a river navigable for gunboats,
we could no doubt succeed in any
operations we might undertake,
we might possibly excite a feeling
of hostility towards us, which would
not be confined to the feudal class.</p>

<p class='c009'>The chief objection to the second
course—that of proceeding against
the daimios separately—would be
that, if it did not lead to a civil
war, the effect of any such retaliation
would be a partial and temporary
measure. The first course we
have suggested is not alluded to by
Sir Rutherford, and as the exodus
of the daimios had not taken place
at the time of the publication of his
work, we have not the advantage
of knowing our author’s views upon
the probable bearing of this important
event upon the politics of
Japan. After discussing the difficulties
attending a policy of conciliation
pushed beyond certain
limits, and the objections to the
alternative of withdrawal, our author
goes on to say:—</p>

<p class='c010'>“The conclusion would seem to be,
that if there was to be any amelioration,
foreign powers must change their tactics;
and if these involved a struggle,
and the nation were passive, the feudal
classes alone being actively engaged in
such a contest (and this is what might
always be expected from all that is
known of the country, always assuming
that no revolutionary element came into
play), the struggle could hardly be a
long one. For, some of the most hostile
princes struck down, the rest would
probably see the necessity of coming to
terms, and suing for peace with a better
estimate of our power to make our
treaty-rights respected, and compel observance,
than has yet entered into the
conception of Japanese rulers. So, possibly,
we might purchase peace, and
trade with freedom from all obstructive
limitations, as well as with security to
life and property. But by no other
means that suggest themselves, after
long and patient study of the people
and their rulers, does this end seem attainable—if
once we break with the
daimios, and the Government which
masks them—to enter upon a course of
coercion.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Such being our author’s views,
it is possible that the measures
here indicated may be those ultimately
adopted; but where the
question is surrounded by so many
difficulties, any policy must be
more or less hazardous. It will be
always easy to wait for the result,
and then find fault with it; but we
think that the considerations we
have advanced are sufficiently complicated
to disarm hostile criticism,
and that we have no right to test
the experiments which our political
agents are forced to make in Japan
by the traditions of diplomacy in
other parts of the world.</p>

<p class='c009'>If we have entered at some length
into the political questions suggested
by Sir Rutherford Alcock’s
book, it is because we deem it important
that people should not
neglect this opportunity of making
themselves acquainted with the
state of our relations with Japan.
We refrain, in mercy to our readers,
from entering upon the great currency
question, which has hitherto
proved the chief stumbling-block
to the successful working of the
Treaty, and which involves an interesting
financial problem. We
will not follow our author into his
dissertations upon consular jurisdiction
in the East, though, were
the subject more popular, there is
much to be said upon it. There is
room for an essay on the merits of
the Japanese civilisation, and Sir
Rutherford touches thoughtfully
upon topics which would afford
interesting matter of philosophical
speculation to a metaphysical mind.
It is in this sense, perhaps, that his
book is so much more suggestive
than any of its predecessors. Our
author has lived long enough in
Japan to study the anomalies presented
by its social and political
institutions; and although his
knowledge of them is necessarily
limited and imperfect, we are forced
to admit that Western civilisation
alone does not suffice to enable us
to construct a system of political
economy, or justify conclusions
based upon the limited experience
of European nations. A Chinese
sinologue, with a German turn of
mind, wrote a book on China and
its rebellions a few years ago, in
which he incorporated an Essay on
Civilisation. We did not agree in
the views it embodied, but we
thought it appropriate to the subject
of his work. Our author, during
the pauses which intervened
between earthquakes, fires, and assassinations,
pondered over kindred
matters, and discusses with us
whether, as regards civilisation,
“nations and individuals attain
the highest state which their
fundamental convictions will allow.”
If there is a part of the
world in which an exile would require
all his philosophy, it is Japan;
and Sir Rutherford probably
amused himself by working out as
a corollary to the above proposition,
“whether the assassination of
the British Minister might fairly be
classed among ‘their fundamental
convictions.’”</p>

<p class='c009'>Our author dwells at some length
upon the varied nature of the obstacles
he has had to encounter in
the course of his diplomacy. The
violence and hostility of the feudal
class is by no means the greatest.
The tactics which the Japanese
employ in carrying their point consists
chiefly in mendacity and evasion.
Nor do they deny that they
are habitually untruthful. Our author
illustrates this by the following
anecdote:—</p>

<p class='c010'>“Upon one occasion, an official having
been found in direct contradiction
with himself, was asked, somewhat
abruptly, perhaps, how he could reconcile
it to his conscience to utter such
palpable untruths? With perfect calmness
and self-possession he replied, ‘I
told you last month that such and such
a thing had been done, and now I tell
you that the thing has not been done at
all. I am an officer whose business it
is to carry out the instructions I receive,
and to say what I am told to say. What
have I to do with truth or falsehood?’”</p>

<p class='c008'>Again, it is sufficient that a proposition
should emanate from the
foreigner for it to excite objection.
In spite of professions to the contrary,
the Japanese raise difficulties
on principle, even when they have
no intention of ultimately refusing
a demand. They are scrupulously
courteous, quick, and subtle, but
often childish in argument. Some
notion of the trivial nature of their
excuses may be formed from the
reply to Colonel Neale’s despatch
to the Japanese Minister narrating
the attempt upon his life, and demanding
the punishment, not only
of the assassins, but of the daimio
whose retainers they were, and who
was specially charged with the defence
of the Legation. This daimio
must have been a party to the attack.
It is thus that the Government
endeavours to screen him,
denying, at the same time, that
there was more than one culprit:—</p>

<p class='c010'>“In the mean time the officer, Ito
Goombio, a retainer of Matsdairn Tamban-no-Kami,
one of the princes intrusted
with the protection of the Legation,
committed suicide, consequently
his corpse was examined; then one
wound caused by the ball of a gun, and
two sword-wounds with which he committed
suicide, were discovered. Taking
these facts into consideration, it is probable
that the same officer managed to
get in by stealth, and was the assailant.
Therefore we have decided that, although
the said officer has committed suicide,
he cannot escape the customary punishment
of this country; and furthermore,
that the officers (retainers) who were
placed there for protection should be
punished, after having been duly examined,
for having been wanting in their
duty. As the said prince, the master of
the criminal officer (retainer), was ordered
by his Majesty the Tycoon to protect
the foreign nations, he did not
neglect to proclaim the order to his
subordinate officers (retainers); but the
design which the criminal officer (retainer),
of his own free-will, and without
fearing death, intended to carry out, was
most likely owing to a temporary derangement
of his mind, brought on by
the present state of affairs being unchangeable,
and being deceived by false
reports, spread about by wanderers, &#38;c.
He therefore, very simply, hated foreign
nations, and forgot the orders he had
received from the Government and his
own master. Your Government will
naturally suppose, from all the facts of
the case, that this proceeds from disaffection
of our Government to your friendship,
which causes us great shame and
sorrow. His Majesty the Tycoon also
regrets the attack on account of her
Majesty the Queen of Great Britain.
Therefore his Majesty has ordered us to
write a letter to your Excellency, in
order to explain all the circumstances of
the case, and to beg pardon for all the
unsuitable occurrences which have taken
place until now, and to testify our friendly
feeling.”</p>

<p class='c008'>How is it possible to deal with
a Government who, when called to
account for a series of massacres,
apologise in this charmingly naïve
way for what they call “unsuitable
occurrences?” How did they propose
to punish the man who had
already committed suicide? And
is “simple hatred” likely to produce
mental derangement? The
Government was evidently not responsible.
The daimio was in no
way to blame. The assassin was
temporarily insane, and, though
dead, would be punished. It is
true, two English marines were
hacked to pieces, with twenty-five
wounds; but the real culprits were
the “wanderers,” who spread a report.
That is a specimen of Japanese
logic.</p>

<p class='c009'>In ordinary criminal offences,
however, the Japanese are prompt
to inflict summary punishment.
Here is an original sentence, forwarded
to the British Consul in an
official letter:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-l c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“To <span class='sc'>F. Howard Vyse</span>, Esq.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in16'><span class='sc'>Kihi</span>,</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><em>Vagabond in the village of Torocmigawa</em>,</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>You have, while in the service of the
English merchant Telge, stolen 300 rio
in his absence, which were kept in an
unlocked box. As this is a great offence,
you are sentenced to be beheaded.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The execution-ground was close
to the gate of the Legation at Yedo,
and gory heads, fresh chopped off
and stuck in clay, occasionally
glared with glassy eyes upon the
passer-by. Not far from Kanagawa
was a burning-ground, not unlike a
threshing-floor; and English travellers,
with a taste for the horrible,
used to make it an object for a ride,
to inspect the human ashes which
were strewn there.</p>

<p class='c009'>But we have looked enough “on
this picture” of Japan—it is time
to look “on that.” Those travellers
who first saw it in its gala-dress
painted it as they found it,
and in some respects have their
glowing descriptions fallen short of
the reality. They never heard of
“lonins,” or experienced any “unsuitable
occurrences.” They saw a
population nude, peaceable, and
contented, a landscape of fairy-like
beauty, a sky unrivalled even in
Italy; and they left before they had
recovered from the charming surprise,
or had time to appreciate the
real value of attractions so novel
and unlooked-for. And yet our
author, after a residence of three
years, writes:—</p>

<p class='c010'>“But for this class of military retainers
and Tycoon officials, high and
low, both of which swarm in Yedo, it
seems it might be one of the pleasantest
places in the Far East. The climate
is superior to that of any other country
east of the Cape. The capital itself,
though spreading over a circuit of some
twenty miles, with probably a couple of
million of inhabitants, can boast what
no capital in Europe can—the most
charming rides, beginning even in its
centre, and extending in every direction
over wooded hills, through smiling
valleys and shady lanes, fringed
with evergreens and magnificent timber.
Even in the city, especially along the
ramparts of the official quarter, and in
many roads and avenues leading thence
to the country, broad green slopes and
temple gardens or well-timbered parks
gladden the eye as it is nowhere else
gladdened within the circle of a city.
No sooner is a suburb gained in any
direction, than hedgerows appear which
only England can rival either for beauty
or neatness, while over all an Eastern
sun through the greater part of the
year throws a flood of light from an
unclouded sky, making the deep shadow
of the overarching trees doubly
grateful, with its ever-varying pictures of
tracery, both above and below. Such is
Yedo and its environs in the long summer-time,
and far into a late autumn.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Our author’s enthusiasm is not
confined to inanimate nature in
Japan. He too, in spite of the disaffection
of a particular class, has
an evident weakness for the country
people, and gives us many pleasing
traits of national character:—</p>

<p class='c010'>“Reflections,” he says, “on the government
and civilisation of the Japanese
press upon the European every step he
takes in this land, so singularly blessed
in soil and climate, so happy in the contented
character and simple habits of its
people, yet so strangely governed by
unwritten laws and irresponsible rulers.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Again—</p>

<p class='c010'>“Much has been heard of the despotic
sway of these feudal lords, and the oppression
under which all the labouring
classes toil and groan; but it is impossible
to traverse these well-cultivated
valleys, and mark the happy, contented,
and well-to-do populations which have
their home amid so much plenty, and
believe we see a land entirely tyrant-ridden
and impoverished by exactions.
On the contrary, the impression is irresistibly
borne in upon the mind that
Europe cannot show a happier or better-fed
peasantry, or a climate and soil so
genial and bountiful in their gifts.”</p>

<p class='c008'>We must agree with our author,
that institutions, however anomalous
they may appear to us, must
have some merit which can so satisfactorily
secure “the material prosperity
of a population estimated
at thirty millions, which has made
an Eden of this volcanic soil, and
has grown in numbers and wealth
by unaided native industry, shut
out from all intercourse with the
rest of the world.” So that Sir
Rutherford, after all, gives quite as
favourable a picture of Japan as
any of the “hasty visitors,” the
accuracy of whose first impressions
he thus impugns:—</p>

<p class='c010'>“Those writers,” he exclaims, “who,
on the strength of a superficial observation,
or a flying visit to Nagasaki, have
led the credulous public in Europe and
America to believe that the triumph of
European civilisation in Japan is already
secure, and that the Japanese Government
is promoting it, must have been
strangely deluded! As to progress and
advance in the path of civilisation, the
papers laid before Parliament at this
period, in which I passed in review the
progress made in the previous six
months—the first after the opening of the
ports under treaties in July last—must
have given a very different impression.”</p>

<p class='c008'>But this is a gloomy view of
affairs not usual with our author;
for a few pages later, remarking on
the effect which foreign trade is
likely to produce, he observes:—</p>

<p class='c010'>“How soon such changes may come
it is impossible to say, seeing what marvellous
progress has marked the last
seven years. Notwithstanding their
long and resolutely-maintained isolation
and exclusivism, carried even into their
political economy, and cherished in the
national mind as their ark of safety
and the shibboleth of their independence,
the day has arrived when a British Minister
can take up his residence in the
capital, and is received by the Tycoon,
not as were the chiefs of the Dutch factory
at Decima—long the only representatives
of Europe—in days now long
passed, and never, it is to be hoped, to
return.”</p>

<p class='c008'>In another place—</p>

<p class='c010'>“They are a well-to-do, flourishing,
and advancing people, and for generations
and centuries have maintained a
respectable level of intellectual cultivation
and social virtues.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Sir Rutherford, in his desponding
mood, cites, as an instance of
the obstructive and unprogressive
policy of the Government, that they
refused to accept an offer made by
Europeans to run monthly a steamer
for them between their own ports;
but he writes more sanguinely
when he gives us an account of a
visit he paid to the Government
steam-factory at Nagasaki:—</p>

<p class='c010'>“I could not but admire the progress
made under every possible difficulty, by
the Japanese and Dutch combined, in
their endeavours to create in this remote
corner of the earth all the complicated
means and appliances for the repair
and manufacture ultimately of steam
machinery.”</p>

<p class='c008'>There he found them making
moderator lamps, and farther on
there was a forge-factory in complete
working order, with a Nasmyth’s
hammer.</p>

<p class='c010'>“And here we saw one of the most
extraordinary and crowning testimonies
of Japanese enterprise and ingenuity,
which leaves all the Chinese have ever
attempted far behind. I allude to a
steam-engine with tubular boilers, made
by themselves before a steam vessel or
engine had ever been seen by Japanese—made
solely, therefore, from the plans
in a Dutch work.”</p>

<p class='c008'>After this we do not think that
the idea which our author ridicules,
of the possibility of railways and
steam communication in Japan, is
so very absurd; considering all that
he has undergone, it is not to be
wondered at that he should occasionally
take a gloomy view of
the people and the country. Generally
he is sanguine and complimentary,
and nobody has had better
opportunities of judging. He has
visited the northern island, ascended
Fusama, spent some weeks at
a Japanese watering-place, where
he found “peace, plenty, apparent
content, and a country more perfectly
and carefully cultivated, and kept
with more ornamental timber everywhere,
than can be matched even in
England.” He made an overland
journey from Nagasaki to Yedo,
which lasted thirty-three days, and
the incidents of which form one of
the most interesting features of the
book. There is an admirable description
of a Japanese play, which,
judged by the light of the future,
seemed to be a rehearsal of the
tragedy about to be perpetrated a
fortnight later on Sir Rutherford
himself. Occasionally the party
traversed the territory of a hostile
daimio; on these occasions the inhabitants
shut themselves up. Thus,
at Nieno, a daimio’s capital—</p>

<p class='c010'>“As we advanced through the streets
we found every house and every side-street
hermetically closed, not a whisper
was to be heard, nor the face of a living
being to be seen. The side streets were
all barricaded and shut out of view by
curtains spread on high poles. His own
house, which we passed, was similarly
masked by curtains. Even in the adjoining
villages no women or children
were to be seen.”</p>

<p class='c008'>These daimios are always followed
by large bodies of armed retainers
in their journeys through
the country, and, as the last murder
of our countryman proves, are not
to be met without danger. On one
occasion, says our author,</p>

<p class='c010'>“Mr De Wit and I were riding
abreast, and without any escort, having
left them far behind, when, seeing rather
a large cortege filling up the road as we
turned an angle, we drew to one side of
the road in single file. No sooner did
the leading officer observe the movement
than he instantly began to swagger, and
motioned all the train to spread themselves
over the whole road; so that all
we gained by our consideration and
courtesy was to run the risk of being
pushed into the ditch by an insolent
subordinate.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Runners always precede these
trains, calling upon the people to
prostrate themselves; and the nobles
are so accustomed to this act of
homage that a European refusing
to perform it incurs a great risk.
Our author enters into great detail
in the account he gives us of the
habits and mode of life of the
common people, for they alone
come under the observation of the
stranger; and we may regard the
work before us as the most exhaustive
description of the country and
the people which we could expect
from the pen of a foreigner. It is,
moreover, admirably illustrated, and
the reader cannot fail to rise from
its perusal more thoroughly enlightened
in all that concerns the
singular people of whom it treats,
than he could hope to be by all the
previous works which have appeared
on the same subject from the days
of the Jesuit fathers. We had marked
many passages illustrative of the
everyday life of the Japanese, and
some graphic descriptions of those
scenes which are most characteristic
and remarkable; but we have dwelt
so long on the political considerations
which have been suggested
to us by the remarks of the author,
that we can only commend his social
sketches to the notice of the reader.
The account of Sir Rutherford’s
audience with the Tycoon is highly
entertaining, and the effect of the
actual ceremony must have been
ridiculous in the extreme. The attitude
of a Japanese in the presence
of a superior almost amounts to
prostration. In one room were
“more than a hundred officers in
grand official costume, all kneeling,
five and six deep, in rows, perfectly
mute, and immovable as statues,
their heads just raised from the
floor.” This attitude, when adopted
by a crowd, is rather striking, perhaps,
than ludicrous; but when the
crowd begin to walk, the effect must
be eminently absurd:—</p>

<p class='c010'>“The most singular part of the whole
costume, and that which, added to the
head-gear, gave an irresistibly comic air
to the whole presentment, was the immeasurable
prolongation of the silk
trousers. These, instead of stopping
short at the heels, are unconscionably
lengthened, and left to trail two or three
feet behind them, so that their feet, as
they advanced, seemed pushed into what
should have been the knees of their garments;
besides this, they often shuffle on
their hands and knees.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The performances of the jugglers,
wrestlers, and top-spinners in Japan
have already been constantly alluded
to, but our author’s experiences
surpass those of former spectators:—</p>

<p class='c010'>“One of the most delicate of the performances
consisted in making a top spin
on the left hand, run up round the edge
of the robe at the back of the neck,
and down the other arm into the palm
of the right hand, still spinning. Another,
again, was to toss a spinning-top
into the air and catch it on the hem of the
sleeve without letting it fall. A third
was to fling it high in the air and catch
it on the bowl or the angle of a Japanese
pipe, pass it behind the back, flinging it
to the front, and then catch it again.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Certainly an importation of Japanese
top-spinners would make
the fortune of any Barnum who
could induce them to leave their
country with the certainty of their
being obliged to rip themselves up
on their return. Let us hope that
the discontinuance of this last trick
may be one of the first-fruits of the
introduction of Western civilisation
into Japan.</p>

  <h2 class='c002'>MRS CLIFFORD’S MARRIAGE.<br> <span class='c016'>PART II.</span></h2>
</div>
<h3 class='c017'>CHAPTER VI.—THE RESULT.</h3>

<p class='c018'>When the newly married people
returned home, after an absence of
about two months, the new rule
soon but gradually made itself felt
at Fontanel. Though Mr Summerhayes
had for a long time been the
inspiring influence there, there was
still all the difference between his
will as interpreted by Mrs Clifford
and his will as accomplished by
himself. Of the two, it must be
allowed that the retainers of the family
preferred the cordial, kind, inconsistent
sway of poor Mary to the
firm and steady government of her
new husband; and then everybody
had acknowledged her right to rule,
which came by nature, while every
soul secretly rebelled against his,
which was a kind of contradiction
to nature. Mr Summerhayes’s path
was not strewn with roses when he
came back to Fontanel; then, for
the first time, he had the worst of
it. After she was fairly married,
and everything concluded beyond
the possibility of change, Mary,
like a true woman, had found it
quite possible to forget all her previous
doubts and difficulties, and to
conclude, with that simple philosophy
which carries women of her class
through so many troubles, that now
everything must come right. It
was no embarrassing new affection
now, but acknowledged duty, that
bound her to her husband, and she
would not contemplate the possibility
of this duty clashing with
her former duties. So she came
home, having fully regained the
composure of her mind, very happy
to see her children again, and utterly
forgetting that they had not
yet become accustomed, as she had,
to look upon “Cousin Tom” as the
head of the house. But it was now
that gentleman’s turn to suffer the
pains and penalties of the new position
which he had taken upon
himself. He was fully conscious
of all the troubled sidelong glances
out of Loo’s brown eyes; and when
Charley burst into the house in
schoolboy exuberance at Easter, for
his few days of holiday, Mr Summerhayes
noted the gulp in the
throat of the Etonian, when he
found it necessary to ask the new
master of the house about something
hitherto settled between himself
and the old groom, with perhaps
a reference to the indulgent
mother, who could never bear to
deprive her boy of any pleasure.
Mr Summerhayes let Charley have
his will with the best grace in the
world, but still saw and remarked
that knot of discontent in the boy’s
throat—that apple of Adam, which
Charley swallowed, consciously, yet,
as he himself thought, unobserved
by any man. The younger children
were perhaps still more difficult
to deal with; for it was hard
to teach them that Mr Summerhayes
was no longer Cousin Tom,
to be romped with, but that it was
necessary to be quiet and good, and
not to disturb the meditations of
the head of the house. True, it fell
to Mary’s lot to impress this fact
upon the rebellious consciousness
of Harry and little Alf; but Mr
Summerhayes, who at that particular
period of his life was all eyes
and ears, and missed nothing, did
not fail to have the benefit. Then
some of the servants were petulant—some
were insolent, presuming
on their old favour with their mistress—some
resigned altogether
when they knew “how things was
agoing to be;” the most part
sneaked and gave in, with secret
reflections, every one of which was
guessed and aggravated by the new
master. It is easy to see that his
position had its difficulties and disagreeables;
but, to do Mr Summerhayes
justice, he behaved with
great temper and forbearance in
this troublesome crisis. He made
it apparent to everybody that he
was not to be trifled with; but, at
the same time, pretended not to see
the little petulancies which were in
reality so distinctly apparent to
him, and which galled him so much.
He swallowed many a mortification
just then more bitter and stinging
than Charley’s soon-forgotten gulp
of boyish pride; and steadily and
gradually, without any one knowing
much about it, the new master
of Fontanel won the day.</p>

<p class='c009'>He was a man whose previous
life had, to a considerable extent,
belied his real character. He had
lived idly and without any apparent
ambition during these forty
years, contenting himself apparently,
for the last ten, with his
dreary old manor-house and spare
income. But this was not because
he was of a light and easy temper,
or satisfied with his lot. He was
active enough in reality, now that
he had affairs in his hands of sufficient
magnitude to occupy him—and
thoughtful enough to keep his
purposes locked in his own heart,
from which they came forth in act
and deed, only when full fledged
and ready for the gaze of the world.
The house of Fontanel gradually
recognised the hand of the master.
Without any visible coercion upon
Mary, the open, liberal, hospitable
house came by imperceptible degrees
under that stern regime
which had made life possible at
the manor-house upon the much
diminished means of the Summerhayes’.
The process was like nothing
so much as the change of a ship’s
course in a stormy sea. The vessel
wavered, reeled for a moment as
the helm went round in the new
direction, but next minute had
righted herself, and was ploughing
steadily on in her new course, leaving
the ignorant passengers below
in total unconsciousness of anything
that had happened, except that
momentary stagger and uncertainty
which it was so easy to account for.
Mary was not cut down, either in
her hospitalities or charities—or at
least, if she was, did not know it;
but before a year had elapsed, the
expenditure in Fontanel house was
smaller, and the expenditure on
Fontanel estate greater than it had
ever been in the memory of man.
Mr Summerhayes was an enterprising
and enlightened landlord. He
took up the Home Farm with such
energy that every tenant-farmer
within twenty miles learned, or
ought to have learned, the salutary
lesson; and he gave loans and
bonuses upon improvement, such as
suggested to the unimproving sundry
sarcasms as to the facility with
which men parted with other people’s
money. If it had been his
own, instead of belonging to his
wife and her children, it would
have made a difference, people said;
but then it was only the unprogressive,
whom Mr Summerhayes
decidedly snubbed and disapproved
of, who made that ill-natured remark.
To tell the truth, however,
when he set out upon this active
career, which was so unlike his
former life, Mr Summerhayes of
Fontanel became much less popular
in the county than the poor
squire at the manor had been in
old days. Perhaps, in the change
from poverty to wealth, he carried
things with too high a hand. Perhaps
he failed to recognise his own
position as an interloper, and acted
the master too completely to please
the popular fancy. At all events,
nobody was satisfied—not even his
sisters in the old house, which they
had all to themselves; certainly not
the little community in his present
home, which obeyed and feared
and suspected him—perhaps not
even his wife.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mary had a woman’s usual experience
before she married her
second husband and made this
complication of affairs. She knew
as a certainty, what all the younger
brides have to learn by hard personal
training, that the husband
must be different from the lover;
that the habits of ordinary life will
return after a while; and that the
wife’s happiness must be of a different
kind, if she is happy at all,
from that of the bride, to whose
pleasure, for the moment, everything
defers by a tender fallacy and
sophism of nature. But somehow,
in its own case, the heart is always
incredulous. To marry him had,
after all, cost this soft woman a
great many natural pangs, and it
was hard to find so soon all the
affectionate conferences and consultations,
by means of which he had
at first won her, ceasing altogether,
and to feel that the affairs which
she had managed so long were now
in inexorable hands, and ruled by
plans which were only communicated
to her when they were ready
for execution, if even then. Then
poor Mary, who had always been
looked on with indulgent eyes, began
to feel herself under a sterner
regard, and to see that her acts and
words were judged solely on their
own merits, and not with any softening
glamour of love, making everything
beautiful because it was she.
It is impossible to describe how nervous
and unsteady this consciousness
made her, and how much more
ready she was to make mistakes,
from knowing that her mistakes
would not be excused, or looked
upon affectionately as wisdom in
disguise. Poor soul! he was very
kind to her at the same time; but
his eye was on when she caressed
her children; his quick ear somehow
caught the little secrets they
whispered to her in that sacred
twilight hour in her dressing-room
before dinner, where Mr Summerhayes
had now acquired the habit
of coming in to talk with his
wife, and finding the children in
the way. When they were all
sent off on such occasions, it was
well for Loo that she generally
headed the retreat, before the new
master lighted his wife’s candles,
and threw an intrusive glare into
the sacred atmosphere. Loo was
a heroine, but she had a temper.
But as for poor Mary, to see her disappointed
children trooping away,
and to guess with quick instinct the
thoughts that were already rising
in their little angry hearts, and to
lose that sweet moment in which
her soul was <i><span lang="fr">retrempé</span></i> and made
strong, was very bitter even to her
yielding temper and loving heart.
She could have cried but for fear
of her husband; and many a time
had bitter drops in her eyes, which
had to be crushed back somehow,
and re-absorbed into her breast,
when those tell-tale candles flashed
their unwelcome light upon her.
Yet, notwithstanding all this, she
had no right nor wish to call herself
an unhappy wife. He <em>was</em>
very kind to her—seemed as though
he loved her, which makes up to a
woman for a great many things; but
still a sense of having overturned
the world somehow, and disturbed
the course of nature—of having introduced
bewilderment and confusion
she could not tell how, and a
false state of affairs—combined, with
a certain ache of disappointment,
of wounded pride, and unappreciated
confidence, to make poor Mary’s
musings weary and troubled, and
to plant thorns in her pillow.</p>

<p class='c009'>Thus it happened that nobody
was pleased with the change which
had taken place at Fontanel, except,
perhaps, Mr Summerhayes himself,
who seemed sufficiently contented
with all that he had done
and was doing. Certainly he devoted
himself to the improvement
of the estate. Such crops had
never been dreamt of in the county
as those that began to be usual
upon the well-tilled acres of the
Home Farm; and, when leases fell
in, the lumbering old tenants had
no chance against the thriving
agriculturists whom the King-Consort
brought in over their heads at
advancing rents, to the benefit of
the rent-roll and the country, though
not without some individual misery
at the same time to lessen the advantage.
Some old people emigrated,
and got their death by it;
some hopeful farmer-families dispersed
and were broken up, and
found but a checkered fortune
awaiting them in the cold world,
outside of those familiar fields which
they had believed themselves born
to cultivate, and almost thought
their own; and Mrs Summerhayes
had red eyes after these occurrences,
and took to headaches, which were
most unusual to her; but it was
unquestionably the most enlightened
policy—it was very good for
the land and the country and things
in general; and, in particular, there
could not be any doubt it was good
for the rent-roll of Fontanel.</p>

<h3 class='c019'>CHAPTER VII.—THE NEXT EVENT IN THE FAMILY.</h3>

<p class='c018'>“I wonder whether Charley Clifford’s
coming of age will be kept
as it ought to be,” said Miss Amelia
Harwood, meditatively. It was
more than five years since the marriage,
but there was still going to
be a bazaar at Summerhayes; and
still a large basket stood on the
drawing-room table at Woodbine
Cottage, full of embroidered cushions,
babies’ socks, children’s pinafores,
and needle-books and pen-wipers
without number, upon
which Miss Amelia was stitching
little tickets which told the price.
“To give him all his honours will
be ticklish work for Tom Summerhayes,
and to withhold them won’t
answer with a boy of spirit like
Charley. I am fond of that boy.
He behaves very well to his mother;
though really, when a woman makes
a fool of herself, I don’t wonder if
her children get disgusted. I should
like to know what she thinks of
her exploit now. I always foresaw
she would see her folly as the children
grew up.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, hush, Amelia,” said her
elder sister; “don’t be hard upon
poor dear Mary now. I was surprised
at the time—but of course
she must have been in love with
him; and it was hard, you know, to
be left all alone at her time of life.
She is quite a young woman now.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“She is——” said Miss Amelia,
pausing, with inexorable memory
and a host of dates at her finger-ends,
“either forty-two or forty-three.
I don’t quite recollect whether she
was born in ‘14 or in ‘15. Now that
I think, it was ‘14, for it was before
the Waterloo year, which we
had all such good cause to remember;
and as for being left all alone,
she had her children, and I always
said she ought to have had the
sense to know when she was well
off. However, that is not the question.
I want to know whether
they will make any ado over Charley’s
coming of age.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Poor boy!—it is sad for him
having no father to advise him at
such an important time of his
life,” said gentle Miss Harwood,
with a sigh.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, stuff!” said Miss Amelia.
“Harry Clifford, poor fellow, never
was wise enough to direct himself,
and how could he have guided his
son? I daresay Tom Summerhayes
would be a better adviser, if you
come to that. But I am sorry for
Charley all the same: he’s the heir,
and yet somehow he doesn’t seem
the heir. His mother, after all, <em>is</em>
still a young woman, as you say,
and Tom Summerhayes seems to
have got everything so secure in
his hands that one can’t help feeling
something is sure to happen to
make the estate his in the end. It
can’t be, I suppose; they said the
deeds were irrevocable, and that
Mary couldn’t alter them if she
wished, which I don’t suppose she
does;—she loves her children,
I must say that for her. Still
one never feels sure with a man
like Tom Summerhayes; and poor
Charley has no more to do with his
own affairs than if he were a little
ploughboy on Mr Summerhayes’s
estate.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Hush, my dear,” said Miss Harwood,
who was in her summer chair,
which commanded, through the
openings of the green blind, a view
of the village green and the road
before the door,—“here are Louisa
and Lydia coming to call—and out
of breath, too; so they must have
some news or something particular
to say.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“About Charley’s coming of age,
of course,” said Miss Amelia. “I
daresay Mary and Tom have had a
fight over it, and he’s judged it as
well for once to let Mary have her
way. He always had a great deal
of sense, had Tom Summerhayes.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, I declare, to see how far the
Miss Harwoods are on with their
things!” cried Miss Louisa Summerhayes,
almost before she had entered
the room; “but you are always in
such good time, Miss Amelia. As
for us, we have such a great deal to
think about just now, it drives the
bazaar out of our heads; almost
as bad as if we had a family ourselves,”
said Miss Lydia, with a
breathless outburst. “I daresay
you have heard the news—you who
always hear everything from Fontanel.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“About Charley’s birthday?”
said Miss Amelia.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, upon my word, you are
a witch of Endor, or something,”
said Miss Lydia, whose turn it was
to begin the duet; “for dear Tom
rode down to tell us only this morning.
He is so considerate, dear
Tom; and I am sure there never
was such a stepfather,—to think of
all he means to do, just as if Charley
was his own son and heir,” cried
Miss Louisa, who was scarcely able
to keep in time for want of breath.</p>

<p class='c009'>“His own son and heir, if he had
one, need not to make so much
commotion, my dears,” said Miss
Amelia, administering with great
goodwill a friendly snub; “there
is a difference, you know, between
Fontanel and the manor-house. I
suppose there will be a dinner of
the tenantry, and all that. There
couldn’t, you know, much as your
family is respected in the county,
be much of that sort of thing at
Summerhayes.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“My dear, you know Amelia always
speaks her mind,” said Miss
Harwood; “you don’t mind what
she says? I am sure I hope poor
Charley will have a good day for his
<em>fête</em>, and that everything will go off
well. I daresay they will all feel
a little strange on such a day, to
think of all the changes that have
happened. I remember, as if it were
yesterday, the day he was born; and
oh how happy poor Mary was!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am sure she ought to be a
great deal happier now,” said Miss
Laura, with a toss of her head, “if
she were sensible enough to see her
advantages. Dear Tom makes himself
a slave to her, and spends all
his strength upon the estate; and
then never to get any thanks for it.
I declare, to hear how you speak is
enough to make one hate the world,”
said Miss Lydia, with the usual
joint disregard of punctuation.
“But, Miss Harwood, you always
take Mary’s side.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I didn’t know we were come
so far as to take sides,” said Miss
Amelia, dryly; “Mary never takes
her own side, that’s clear. She tries
to please everybody, poor soul;
to make her husband happy by
letting him suppose himself the
master of Fontanel,—and to make
her son happy by making believe
he’s all right and in his natural
place; and what’s to come of it all
after Charley comes of age is more
than I can tell; for Charley’s a boy
of spirit, though he’s devoted to his
mother, and it’s hard never to have
anything to say in one’s own affairs.
A woman may submit to it, perhaps,
but a young man is very different,”
said Miss Amelia, with
great gravity, breaking off with an
emphatic jerk the last end of her
thread.</p>

<p class='c009'>Both the sisters were in tears
before this speech was finished. “I
am sure it is very hard,” sobbed the
elder, as soon as she could speak,
“to be in dear Tom’s position, and
to have to manage everything, and
always to hear it brought up against
him that he has nothing to do with
the estate, and it belongs to his
wife. I wonder how he ever puts up
with it,” cried the other, “dear Tom,
that is the head of one of the oldest
families in the county—far better
blood than the Cliffords, whose
great-grandfather was in trade; and
they would all have been ruined
but for dear Tom,” concluded Miss
Louisa; “he has given himself up
to their interests—and this is his
reward!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Hush, now,” said Miss Harwood,
“I am sure nothing was said
that could make you cry; and I see
poor dear Mary herself in the pony-carriage
driving down by the green.
I daresay she will call here. She
will be quite surprised if she sees
you have been crying. Shouldn’t
you like to run up-stairs and set
your bonnets straight?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I daresay she’ll come in looking
as bright as possible,” said Miss
Amelia, “and could not understand,
if we were to tell her, why
we should quarrel and cry over her
affairs. After all, it’s a shame she
shouldn’t be happy, poor soul; she
always makes the best of everything.
There she is, kissing her
hand to us already. How d’ye do,
my dear? And I am sure I think
she’s as pretty now as when she was
twenty, whatever the men may say.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh dear, that’s just what the
men say,” cried Miss Louisa, with
indignation, unable even at this
crisis to resist the temptation;
“for she always was a gentleman’s
beauty,” added Miss Lydia, half
under her breath. They were not
in the least malignant, and both of
them secretly liked Mary in their
hearts; but they could not resist the
opportunity of throwing a little
javelin at her, which certainly did
her no harm.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mary did not reach the door until
her sisters-in-law had put themselves
in order by the help of the
mirror in the back drawing-room.
All this time Miss Amelia stood by
the window making her comments.
“Of course there is a basket to be
taken out of the pony-carriage,”
said that mollified observer, who
was nodding and smiling all the
time to the new arrivals, “with a
quantity of forced things in it, no
doubt; for there’s nothing else to
be had at this time of the year. I
think I can see strawberries through
the lid, which, considering it is only
March, is flying in the face of nature,
I think. And here is Loo.
Well, I am not sure that poor Loo
is not as much forced as the strawberries;
she looks a long way older
than her mother, it appears to me.
Poor thing! perhaps it’s not wonderful
under the circumstances;
and I think Loo would be pretty
if she was free in her mind, or had
time for anything but brooding over
affairs. She is, let me see, eighteen
at her next birthday——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Hush, Amelia! My dear Mary,
it makes me very happy to see you,”
said old Miss Harwood, rising from
her comfortable chair, with the slow
motion of an old woman, to meet
the kiss of the mistress of Fontanel.
Perhaps it was the contrast
of true old age which made Mary,
though convicted of having been
born in the year ‘14, appear then,
in ‘57, so blooming and fresh and
youthful. She had lived, on the
whole, a quiet life. She had little
in her constitution of that rabid
selfishness which people call a sensitive
temperament. She bore her
troubles meekly, and got over them;
and even the anxieties and uneasiness
of recent years had added but
few wrinkles to the fair face of a
woman who always believed that
everything would turn out well,
and heartily hoped for the best.
She came in, well-dressed, well-conditioned,
sweet to look at and to
listen to, in easy matronly fulness
and expansion, into the pretty but
strait and limited room where the
two old sisters lived their life; and
when she had kissed them, kissed
also the two younger maidens, who
were, however, of Mary’s own
standing—no younger than herself.
They all looked grey, and relapsed
into the shade in presence of her
sweet looks and natural graciousness.
Even Loo, who stood behind
her mother’s chair—a tall girl, still
with great brown eyes, which counted
for twice as much as their real
size in her pale face—looked, as Miss
Amelia said, old beside Mrs Summerhayes.
Hers were the bright
but softened tints, the round outlines,
the affectionate, tender, unimpassioned
heart, which confers perpetual
youth.</p>

<p class='c009'>“How nice it is to see you looking
so well!” said Mary. “I don’t
think you have grown a bit older,
dear Miss Harwood, for twenty
years. Loo and I have come down
on purpose to ask you to come
to Fontanel for Charley’s birthday.
He comes of age, dear fellow, next
month, you know; and as it is a
very very great occasion, we thought
a three weeks’ invitation was not
too much. You must come to us
the day before—the carriage will
come for you—and stay at least
till the day after, so that you may
not be the least fatigued. We
are going to have all sorts of pleasures
and rejoicing; and I am
sure, though I am a foolish old mother
to say so,” said the smiling,
blooming woman, in whom light
and sunshine seemed to have entered
Miss Harwood’s drawing-room,
“that nobody has more reason
to rejoice over a son than I—than
we have,—he has always been
such a dear boy; he has never
given me any anxiety all his life.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, he’s only just beginning
his life,” said Miss Amelia. “What
anxiety could he give you, except
about the measles and so forth?
To be sure he might have been
plucked at the university, or rusticated,
or something dreadful; but
I allow he’s a good boy, and not
too good a boy either—which is a
great comfort. I am glad you are
not going to stint him at his <em>fête</em>:
an eldest son has a right to that, I
suppose; but I hope you mean to
let him have something to do, my
dear, after he comes of age.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“To do? Oh, I daresay he will
ynd quite enough to do, for a few
fiears, amusing himself,” said Mary,
perceptibly growing paler for the
moment. “Of course I am calculating
upon both of you, Louisa
and Liddy,” she said, turning
round with an air of making her
escape. “To ask such near friends
formally would be nonsense, you
know; but you must not forget the
twenty-fifth; and I hope you will
come early, too, and see the preparations,
and the tenants’ dinner, and
all that is to go on out of doors.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, we have got an invitation
already,” said Miss Laura. “Not
that we would have come unless
you had asked us besides, dear
Mary,” chimed in Miss Lydia; “but
dear Tom called this morning to
tell us it was all decided upon,”
they both ran on together. “Such
a comfort to our minds; for I am
sure Liddy and I cannot bear to
hear you ever have any difference of
opinion,” cried Miss Laura, as her
solo broke upon the course of the
duet. “And dear Tom is always
so glad to do what will please you,
dear Mary,” chimed Miss Lydia, as
it came to her turn.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mary turned red and then turned
pale in spite of herself. Most
people have some specially sensitive
spot about them, and this was
Mary’s: she could not endure to
think that her husband consulted
his sisters about things that occurred
at Fontanel.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I was not aware we had any
difference of opinion,” she said,
with dignity; “things always have
to be discussed, and Mr Summerhayes
likes to consider everything
well before he takes it in
hand; but, of course, we can have
but one mind about Charlie, who
really is the owner of the estate, or
at least will be after the twenty-fifth.
He is so popular already,” continued
the mother, returning to the Miss
Harwoods. The tears came to poor
Mary’s eyes, notwithstanding all
her efforts. She felt they were all
watching her, and that to do justice
both to her son and her husband
was all but impossible; and,
besides, at that moment she was
under the influence of a little irritation.
Mr Summerhayes did not
<em>consult</em> his sisters, for whose judgment
he had a much greater contempt
than it had ever entered into
the mind of Mary to entertain for
any one in the world; but when
he was annoyed or irritated he occasionally
took the benefit of their
unreasoning sympathy and partisanship,
as he had done this morning—and
there was nothing in all the
business which so galled and exasperated
his wife.</p>

<p class='c009'>“He always was a dear boy,”
said kind old Miss Harwood; “and
such a sweet baby as he was, my
dear. I remember when he was
born as if it were yesterday. I was
just saying so before you came in.
I never saw any people so happy
as you, and—hem—it seems foolish,
to be sure, talking of what he was
as a baby now he’s a man,” she
concluded, hurriedly stumbling over
that unlucky allusion. Mary again
grew a little pale, poor soul. She
could not escape from her troubles
anyhow—they hemmed her in on
every side.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And so all those things are for
the bazaar,” she said, by way of
making a diversion. “Loo was to
have worked you something, Miss
Amelia, but Loo’s fingers are not so
useful as they might be. She is a
great deal too fond of dreaming;
but I don’t think I was very fond
of work myself when I was her
age; and, of course, she has something
in hand for Charley. A birthday
would not be a birthday if the
girls had not worked something for
their brother; though men are such
bears, as I sometimes tell Loo,”
said poor Mary, beaming brightly
out again from behind her cloud,
“I don’t think they ever look twice
at the purses and slippers we do for
them. I suppose the great pleasure
is in the doing, as it is with most
other things.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But I am sure you never found
it so with dear Tom,” said Miss
Laura; “he was always, from a boy,
so pleased with what we made for
him. Oh, do you remember those
old braces, Laura?” cried Miss
Lydia; “he always appreciates
what is done for him—always,”
and both the sisters chimed in in a
breath.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I was not speaking of Mr Summerhayes,”
said Mary, returning
into the cloud; “I was speaking of—men
in general. I have never
had any perfect people to deal with
in my experience,” said the mistress
of Fontanel, with a sidelong, female
blow, which she could not resist
giving. “And now we must say
good-bye, dear Miss Harwood; it is
so pleasant to see you, and to come
into this sheltered place where nothing
ever seems to change.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It is very odd,” said Miss Amelia,
as she rose to shake hands with
her visitors, “you people who are
living and going through all sorts
of changes, you like to come back to
look at us old folks, and to say it is
pleasant to see us immovable. I
suppose it has all the effect of a
calm background and bit of still
life, as the painters say. Perhaps
we don’t enjoy it so much as you
do; we like to have something
happen now and then for a little
variety; we are often sadly at a
loss, if you did but know it, for an
event.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Come back soon, my dear; that
will be an event for us,” said Miss
Harwood, whose soft old kiss was
balm to Mary’s cheek, which had
flushed and paled so often. Miss
Laura and Miss Lydia went out to
the door with their sister-in-law,
where they took leave of her. “We
meant to have driven on to the
manor-house,” said Mary; “but
we need not go now, since we have
seen you; and there is no room in
this stupid little carriage, or I would
set you down anywhere. Good-bye!
don’t forget the twenty-fifth!” and
so she drove her ponies away. The
sisters went off upon their usual
round of calls, discussing her, while
Mrs Summerhayes drove through
the village. They were not exactly
spiteful women, and they <em>did</em> like
poor Mary in their hearts: if she
had been in trouble they would
have rallied to her with all their
little might; but they could not
help being a little hard upon her
now.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Did you hear what she said
about Charley being the true owner
of the estate?” said Miss Laura.
“After all dear Tom has done!” said
Miss Lydia. “Oh, how strangely
things do turn out!” cried the elder
sister. “He might have done so
much better; and to get himself
into all this trouble and nobody
even grateful to him,” said the
younger. “Poor dear Tom!” they
both cried together, “he deserved
such a different wife.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Such was the aspect of affairs on
the other side; and though it is
natural to take part with poor
Mary rather than with her subtle
and skilful husband, perhaps his
sisters were not altogether wrong.
If they had not, all of them, got
somehow into conflict with nature,
things might have happened very
differently. As it was, a perpetual
false position created mischief on
every side.</p>

<h3 class='c019'>CHAPTER VIII.—THE EVE OF THE BIRTHDAY.</h3>

<p class='c018'>“I have asked old Gateshead to
bring over the deeds you executed
before our marriage, Mary,” said
Mr Summerhayes, a few days before
Charley came of age; “I want to
look over them again.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes!” said Mary, stopping suddenly
in what she was doing, and
giving one furtive glance at him.
She asked no farther question, but
waited with an anxious intensity of
interest which almost stopped the
breath on her lips.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I want to look over them again—there
are some words in the duplicates
up-stairs I don’t feel quite sure
about,” said Mr Summerhayes.</p>

<p class='c009'>“But, Tom, you told me they
were irrevocable, and never could
be meddled with,” said Mary, with
a sudden flush of burning colour,
which passed away immediately,
leaving her very pale. It had been
all her comfort for many a day to
think that those deeds were beyond
her power—or his—to change. She
could not help trembling in this
sudden terror. She had no confidence
in her own power to resist
him—and, alas, but a wavering, uncertain
confidence in him, that he
would be able to resist the temptation
of securing, if a change were
possible, a stronger title to all the
authority and power he at present,
in her right, possessed.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Do you imagine I want them
meddled with?” said Mr Summerhayes.
“I don’t think women understand
what honesty or honour
means,” he added, in his harshest
tone. “I suppose you believe I am
ready to perjure myself, or break
my word, or do anything that’s
base, for a bit of your estate.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Indeed, Tom, I never thought
anything of the kind,” said poor
Mary, faltering; but she had
thought something of the kind,
though her thoughts were incapable
of such decided expression, and the
tremor in her voice betrayed her.</p>

<p class='c009'>“That’s how it always is,” said
Mr Summerhayes, without any passion,
but with a concentrated sneer
in his voice; “a woman who has
anything always suspects her husband
of an intention to rob her.
Though she may have lived with
him for years, and known his
thoughts and shared his plans, and
thought him good enough to be her
companion and protector, the moment
she recurs to her money he
becomes a robber, and nothing is
too base for him to do. No,” he
went on, breathing out a long
breath of indignation apparently,
and offended virtue; “I don’t want
to alter the deeds—but I want to
read over one clause with Gateshead,
to make sure it’s all right.
You would not like your children
to go to law about it after you are
dead?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No,” said Mary, with a slight
shiver; her fears and her imagination
were roused. She, of course,
knew nothing about the law, except
a general impression that it
was never safe to have anything to
do with it.  She had, however,
an unreasoning faith in the efficacy
of anything solemnly signed and
witnessed, which, notwithstanding,
if anybody threw the least doubt
upon that document, changed instantly
into a total scepticism and
unbelief of any value in it at all.
She jumped at conclusions, as is the
habit of women; and from the most
perfect confidence in the security of
Fontanel, instantly plunged into the
wildest uneasiness about it, and already
saw herself compelled to alienate
the inheritance from her children;—and
all this because Mr Summerhayes
had remarked some expression
in one clause which struck him
as of doubtful meaning,—at least
that was all the actual foundation upon
which Mary could build her fears.</p>

<p class='c009'>So it was with feelings of an
extremely mingled and doubtful
character that she proceeded with
her arrangements for the birthday
<em>fête</em>, which, to tell the truth, Mr
Summerhayes had strongly opposed—he
could not very well have told
why. Charley was the heir of the
estate—as indisputable as if his
father had been still its master;
yet there was a great difference;
and perhaps the stepfather did not
feel himself quite equal to the
necessary speeches, nor to the cordiality
which would be required of
him on such a day. Mr Summerhayes
had managed everything so
completely in his own way—he had
felt the house so entirely his own
these five years, which yet was not
his own, nor vested in him by any
natural right—that the idea of
acknowledging as much virtually,
if not in distinct words, by this
public recognition of the heir, galled
him strangely. He would rather
have gone out of the way; but as
he could not go out of the way, he
adopted, half unconsciously, the
only mode that remained of making
himself disagreeable—he found
out that possible flaw in the deed.
Probably nothing further was in
his thoughts than to express the
discontent in his mind, and throw
a little shadow of insecurity upon
the festivities which were sacred to
the too-confident heir. Like an ill-tempered
father keeping up his
power by a vague threat of altering
his will, Mr Summerhayes waved
his threatening flag over the heads
of the family at Fontanel by this
faint cloud of suspicion thrown
upon the invincible certainty of the
deed. He meant nothing more;
but evil thoughts are suggestive,
and have a wonderful power of
cumulation. Perhaps he did mean
something more before old Gateshead,
whom, on other occasions, he
did not hesitate to call an old fogy,
was disembarked from his old-fashioned
chaise at the door, two
days before Charley’s birthday.
The firm was Gateshead and Gateshead—but
Europe and Asia are not
more unlike than were its two
members. The elder was, as Mr
Summerhayes succinctly expressed
it, an old fogy—the other, an acute
and tolerably accomplished young
man of the world. Mr Courtenay
Gateshead, in ordinary cases, was
Mr Summerhayes’s favourite, and
was honoured with his confidence;
but on this special occasion old Mr
Gateshead—whose acuteness was
somewhat blunted by age—who
was a wonderful gossip and genealogist,
and who had the most profound
respect for the superior legal
knowledge of the master of Fontanel,
who had once been of the
Inner Temple—was, as an old friend
of the family, the selected guest.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mr Gateshead arrived with a big
portmanteau and a little tin box.
He was rather nervous about this
little tin box. He carried it into
the drawing-room with him, where
he went on his arrival, being a great
deal too early for dinner, as old
fogies, who are not much wanted in
the drawing-room, generally are.
But Mary was very glad to see him,
as an old friend, and looked at him
with a kind of half-conscious appeal
in her eyes, of which Mr Gateshead
was totally unaware, and which he
would have been completely bewildered
by could he have seen it. He
made some absurd mistakes to be
sure. He called her Mrs Clifford, even
in Mr Summerhayes’s presence; and
then, instead of prudently ignoring
his mistake, begged her pardon, and
laughed and talked of his bad memory.
But the tin box was a heavy
burden on the old man’s mind.
Every ten minutes or so, he paused
in his talk, which was voluminous,
to say, “Bless my soul, where is
that box?” and to shift it from
the table or chair on which he
had placed it, to a chair or table
nearer. The box oppressed him
even in the midst of the gossip in
which his soul delighted. He took
it up to his room with him, but
hesitated, not seeing how he could
leave it by itself when he came
down to dinner; and at last gratefully
accepted Mr Summerhayes’s
offer to put it in his own study,
where all his own papers were, and
which nobody dared go into. It
seemed safe under the secure shelter
of Mr Summerhayes, whose absolute
monarchy was indisputable, and
with whose personalities nobody in
Fontanel ventured to interfere.
There, accordingly, the tin box was
deposited, and there, after dinner,
somewhat reluctantly on the part of
old Gateshead, who was fond of the
society of ladies, and of Mrs Summerhayes’s
in particular, the two
gentlemen adjourned, to talk over
that flaw, or possibility of a flaw,
in the deeds which were the safeguard
of the young Cliffords. They
sat late discussing that and other
affairs,—so late, that it seemed quite
the middle of the night to Mary
when her husband awoke her with
a cheerful face, to say that Gateshead
was of opinion—and he agreed
with him, after the close examination
they had given it—that the
deed was quite unassailable, so that
she might have a perfectly easy
mind on the subject. “I thought
I might run the risk of a cross look
for breaking your sleep, Mary, when
this was what I had to say. I am
very glad myself, for it might have
been awkward, as no power was
reserved to you under our settlement
of will-making, or that sort
of thing,” said Mr Summerhayes.
“However, it’s all right. I left
that old fogy pottering over his tin
box in my study. I hope he’ll not
set himself on fire before he gets to
bed. He’s getting old very fast,
Mary. Young Courtenay will soon
have everything his own way.”
Poor Mary was so pleased, so delighted,
so thankful, that it was a
long time before she could get to
sleep again. She lay half dreaming
and dozing, with an exquisite compunction
and renewal of love in her
heart. Had she perhaps suspected
this good husband, who came so
joyfully to tell her that all was
safe? She made it up to him by
the fullest, most lavish restoration
of confidence, as was natural to a
generous woman; and in the happiest
thankful state of mind, though
with an odd half-dreaming fancy
that old Gateshead had set fire to
himself, and that she smelt his
nightcap smouldering into slow destruction,
fell finally, when it was
almost dawn, into a sound sleep.</p>

<p class='c009'>But Mary could not believe that
she had been more than a few
minutes asleep when she was awoke
by the horrible clangour of the
alarm-bell, and by the rushing and
screaming of all the servants.
Could it be old Gateshead’s nightcap
that caused that terrible significant
sniff of burning that pervaded
the entire atmosphere? Before she
could wake her husband, who lay
in a profound sleep, Charley had
rushed in at the door with the
alarming cry of fire. “Fire!—get
up, mother, make haste, but don’t
flurry yourself; put something on;
it’s in the west wing. There’s
time to escape,” cried Charley.
“I’ll get out the children, and come
back for you,” he said, as he rushed
off again. “Fire!” cried Mr Summerhayes,
springing up. “Good
heavens! It’s that old fool, old
Gateshead How could I be so mad
as to trust him by himself?” and
almost before Mary knew he was
awake, he too had rushed out of the
room, drawing on his dressing-gown
as he flew out at the door. “Oh
Tom, see to the children; don’t
leave me!” cried Mary in her
fright, and she too wrapped herself
hastily in the first garment she
could find, and rushed to the door.
She could see nothing but a thick
volume of smoke pouring from the
west wing through the entire house,
into which her husband’s figure
disappeared, while every soul in the
place seemed emerging out of it in
different varieties of fright and undress.
“We’ve sent off for the fire-engines;
and don’t be alarmed,
mother, it’s entirely in the west
wing,” cried Charley, who came towards
her with Alf in one arm and
little Mary in the other. Harry
and Loo came crouching close to
the big brother behind—all silent,
all ready to cry, all staring with wide-open,
suddenly-awakened eyes, and
frightened out of their very lives.
“Oh Charley, Mr Summerhayes will
be killed! Where is he going? Is
it to look for Mr Gateshead?” cried
Mary, who, when she saw her children
safe, fell into a panic about
her husband. He had rushed into
the very depths of that black volume
of smoke, in spite of many
warning voices. He came staggering
back after a few minutes, half
suffocated, to the staircase, where
he sat down to recover himself.
“Oh Tom, Mr Gateshead is safe,”
cried Mary, who was shivering in
her shawl with cold and terror, and
who would not leave her husband,
though the smoke came nearer and
nearer. “D—Mr Gateshead,” cried
the excited master of the house.
“Charley, fly to the other side—to
the window—my study—the tin
box! I’ll take care of your mother,”
he shouted, as Charley appeared
coming back. When he had
placed Mary in safety, Mr Summerhayes
himself hurried to the same
spot. It was he alone who mounted
the ladder, though everybody
else said it was madness. But it
would have been as sane a proceeding
to walk into a furnace as into
that room, which was the very
centre of the fire. He came down
again deadly pale, and almost fainting,
with a hurt on his head from a
falling beam, and half suffocated
with the fiery smoke. The tin box
was beyond the possibility of redemption.</p>

<p class='c009'>But the fire, curiously enough,
scarcely penetrated beyond the west
wing, which was an unimportant
part of the house—a recent addition,
where nobody slept, and which, indeed,
contained little that was important
except Mr Summerhayes’s
study, which had been built after
his own design, and contained all
his pet and personal belongings.
Mary and the children watched from
the gardener’s cottage the working
of the fire-engines; and in the excitement
of seeing how the fire was
got under, and how little damage,
after all, was done to Fontanel, forgot
the misery of the morning and
their comfortless circumstances.
Even Loo felt that her stepfather
was to be regarded as a hero, when
he came, pale, black, and begrimed—after
it became apparent
that the work of destruction was
stopped—to the cottage to have his
head bound up, and to see that his
wife and her children were safe.
And perhaps Loo was still better
disposed towards him when she
found that he did not take upon
himself any heroic airs, but was in
a most savage temper, cursing old
Gateshead as nobody had ever before
heard Mr Summerhayes curse
any man. “I was rash not to see
him safe to bed,” cried the master
of the burning house; and Mary
did all she could, in her generous
way, to deprecate and excuse “the
poor old man.” “Nobody is to
blame; it must have been an accident—only
an accident,” said Mary;
and Mr Summerhayes, in his rage
and vexation, had not even the
grace to be civil to her, but still muttered
curses upon old Gateshead.</p>

<p class='c009'>While, for his part, Mr Gateshead
went round and round what
had been the west wing, wringing
his hands. “Burned!—lost!—my
tin box. I will never dare look
Courtenay in the face again; and,
good Lord! what’s to become of
the children?” cried the poor old
lawyer. He could not help hearing
some of Mr Summerhayes’s passionate
exclamations, and perceived, by
the way everybody hustled past him,
that he was blamed for the sudden
calamity. Though he was an old
fogy, he was as sensitive as any
man to a personal grievance. Very
soon he began to think about this
mysterious business. “Good Lord,
the deed! the poor dear children!”
said the old lawyer to himself. He,
too, grew angry and pale with
indignation; but he kept silence
and his own counsel. This was the
strange and ill-omened event which
happened at Fontanel the day before
Charley’s coming of age.</p>

<h3 class='c019'>CHAPTER IX.—THE FIRE AND ITS CONSEQUENCES.</h3>

<p class='c018'>The idea of a fire—of a fire in
one’s own house, darkly raging in
the silence of the night, threatening
death to helpless sleepers in their
beds—is too overwhelming at first
to allow the minds of the startled
sufferers in ordinary circumstances
to enter into details. Mary, for her
part, found so many things to be
grateful for,—first, she was so
thankful that all were safe—second,
so glad to find that even the house
was not injured to any serious degree,—and,
third, so proud of the
energy and zeal of her husband,—that
the real loss was a long time
of becoming fairly visible to her.
Before it dawned upon his mother,
Charley, worn out as he was by his
exertions, had realised what it was;
and had felt, with a strange momentary
thrill and shock through
his whole frame, that the foundations
of the world were crumbling
under his feet, and that he dared
no longer boast of the morrow.
Loo too, who had been almost enthusiastic
about her stepfather in
that first hour of his heroism,
had fallen back again, and was
paler than ever, and looked more
wistfully out of her background
with those great brown eyes.
But still Mary continued to kiss
little Alf, who was rather impatient
of the process, and rejoice
over her children. “If it had
broken out anywhere else,” she
said, “we might all have been
burned in our beds. Was it not a
wonderful interposition of Providence,
Tom, when there was to be
a fire, to think it should be there?
We had not even any associations
with the west wing—except you,
dear—I am sure I beg your pardon—but
you rather enjoyed building
the study, and you must make
another one. I shall always think
it a special Providence the fire was
there.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You don’t know what you’re
saying, Mary,” said her husband;
“it was not Providence, it was
that confounded old——Oh, Mr
Gateshead! are you in the least
aware how this happened? Did
you drop your candle, or a match,
or anything? or were you burning
any of your papers? It is a horrible
misfortune to have happened
just now.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But really, Tom, the house is
so little injured it won’t matter for
to-morrow,” said Mary; “things
can go on just as before.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh!” said her husband, with
a little groan, “don’t talk so lightly;
you don’t know what’s happened.
Gateshead, why on earth didn’t
you go at once to bed?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mr Summerhayes, I’ll thank
you to leave off that sort of thing,”
said the old lawyer, divided between
fear and indignation. “I
am not stupid, sir, as you try to
make people believe, though I am
older than you are. It’s a very
strange circumstance, but if Providence
has not done it, as you say,
neither have I. But I’ll tell you
what is your duty, Mr Summerhayes.
Before I leave here, which
shall be to-day, I’ll draw out a
draught-deed to correspond with
this one that is unfortunately
burnt——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What deed do you mean?
burnt?” cried Mary, in dismay;
“not <em>that</em> deed——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, Mrs Clifford—I beg your
pardon, Mrs Summerhayes—exactly
<em>that</em> deed,” said the solicitor;
“and you should not lose a moment
in executing it over again—not a
moment, especially considering that
Charley is just of age.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“<em>That</em> deed!” cried Mary; “oh
Tom!” She turned to him in
simple distress and lamentation; but
he met her eyes with such a strange
defiance, and the colour rose so
perceptibly in his cheek, that Mary
stopped short petrified. What did
it mean? She turned round alarmed,
and met the curious eyes of
old Gateshead, who was studying
her looks, with something like
confusion. For the moment her
heart, as she thought, stopped
beating in poor Mary’s troubled
breast.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You should not lose a moment—it
ought to be done over again,”
said the old man, “while I am here,
to prevent any informality. It
ought at once to be done over
again.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mrs Summerhayes unfortunately
has no power to do anything,”
said her husband. “No such unfortunate
chance was calculated upon
at our marriage. No right was
reserved to her of making any
settlement. You know that well
enough, Gateshead.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That can be obviated by your
joining with her,” said the lawyer.
“You could do that, at least, till
there’s time to take advice on the
subject; for burning only revokes
where there’s an intention of revoking,
as you’re aware, Mr Summerhayes—and
so long as we can
prove what was the general purport——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“In that case, there’s no need for
doing anything further,” said the
master of Fontanel.</p>

<p class='c009'>“But the matter is too important
to be left on a chance,” said the old
lawyer, anxiously; “nobody can
ever tell what may happen. For
Charley’s sake you ought not to lose
an hour. I’ll draw up a draft——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, Tom, listen to Mr Gateshead!”
cried poor Mary, trying to
smile, though her heart felt as if it
were breaking, as she laid a timid,
beseeching hand on his arm.</p>

<p class='c009'>Her husband threw her hand
lightly off, and turned away. “There
is no reason in the world why we
should rush into fresh documents,”
he said. “Stuff! we are not going
to die to-day; and if we did die to-day,
why, Mary, your heirs are as
safe as ever they were. I’ll think
it over, Gateshead, and see Courtenay
about it. There is no hurry;
and, upon my word, whatever you
may think on the subject, I have
had about enough of excitement for
one day.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Does your head ache, Tom?”
said Mrs Summerhayes.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Abominably; and look here,”
said her husband, exhibiting his
hands, which were considerably
burned, “if I am to be made fit
for presentation to-morrow, you’ll
have to nurse me, Mary. Come
along, I have a great deal to talk to
you about. I beg your pardon,
Gateshead, but now that everything
is safe, considering what I have before
me to-morrow, I must get a
little rest.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then I am to understand that
you refuse to do anything in place
of the deed that has been burned,”
said the old lawyer.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Refuse! certainly not; I’ll
think of it, and see Courtenay about
it. We can talk it over at dinner,”
said Mr Summerhayes, walking
away calmly towards the house with
his wife.</p>

<p class='c009'>This conversation had taken place
at the gardener’s cottage, within
hearing of Loo, who had all this
time been standing at the window.
When Mary and her husband went
away, the old lawyer uttered a
furious and profane exclamation.
“He’ll speak to Courtenay. I’m
not to be trusted, I suppose; confound
the upstart!” cried old Gateshead;
“but I shan’t stay here to be
insulted by Tom Summerhayes.
Lord bless us! what’s the matter,
my dear?”</p>

<p class='c009'>This question was addressed to
Loo, who came suddenly up to him,
overwhelming the old man with
the gaze of her great brown eyes.
“Tell me only one thing—is Charley
disinherited?” said Loo, grasping
with her slight but firm fingers the
lawyer’s arm.</p>

<p class='c009'>“My dear, you don’t understand
it,” said Mr Gateshead.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I understand it perfectly; is
Charley disinherited?” asked the
anxious girl.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, my dear, it depends on
circumstances,” said the lawyer;
“don’t look at me so fiercely, it is
not my doing. The deeds are destroyed—that’s
all. I daresay it
won’t make any difference. We
can prove——Don’t cry, my dear
child; <em>I</em>‘ll stand by you if he tries
to do anything—and you can tell
your brother so. It shan’t make
any difference if I can help it—don’t
cry.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t mean to cry,” said
Loo, with indignation; “is this
why the fire was?” The words
seemed to drop from her lips before
she was aware; then a violent blush
rushed over poor Loo’s pale face;
she shrank back, and took her hand
from his arm, and turned her face
away. “I did not mean to say
that; I meant to say—I understand,”
said Loo, slowly. It was a
very woe-begone despairing face
that she turned upon him when she
looked round again. The old man,
who had known her all her life,
patted her on the head as if she had
been still a child.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Don’t be afraid, my dear, things
will come straight; though your
stepfather has been rude to me, I
will not go away for your sakes,”
said Mr Gateshead; but such a
conversation as this could not be
carried on. The lawyer returned
to the house to be present at the
investigation into the cause of the
fire which Mr Summerhayes was
already making; and Loo, for her
part, sick at heart, and in a state
of the profoundest despair, went
out to seek her brother. It was
just as well for both that they did
not meet that morning; for neither
of the two in their hearts had any
doubt upon the subject. As for
their mother, she kept by her husband’s
side, in a state of mind not
to be described; taking hope by
times; listening with eager anxiety
to hear any explanation that could
be offered; trying to believe that
he only hesitated to replace the
destroyed deed because he had no
confidence in old Gateshead, and
preferred to consult Courtenay; but
in her heart feeling, like Charley,
that total shipwreck had happened,
and that the foundations of the
earth were giving way.</p>

<h3 class='c019'>CHAPTER X.—A VERY SURPRISING OCCURRENCE.</h3>

<p class='c018'>The ruins of the west wing were
clearly visible from the great wooden
building erected by Mr Summerhayes
in the park where the tenants
were to dine. It was too cold in
March for a tent; and there was
no room in Fontanel large enough
for these festivities, except the great
double suite of drawing-rooms where
the doors had been removed, and
where there was to be a ball at
night. Much was the talk about
the alarming event of the previous
day, which had shaken half the
country with personal terrors, much
warmer than are generally awakened
by the intelligence of a fire at a
friend’s house. On hearing of it,
every soul within twenty miles had
sighed with resignation or cried out
with impatience, giving up all hopes
of the festivities to which everybody
had been looking forward; but Mr
Summerhayes’s messengers with the
intimation that all was going on as
before, came about as soon as the
news of the calamity. Mr Summerhayes
himself was more gracious,
more cordial, than anybody had
ever known him. He spoke of
“our dear boy” in his speech to
the farmers, and described Charley
in such terms, that the heart of
Charley’s mother was altogether
melted, and she felt ready to commit
the fate of her children a dozen
times over into her husband’s hands.
Nothing could be more manly, more
honourable, more affectionate, than
the way in which Mr Summerhayes
spoke of his own position. He was,
he said, his wife’s steward and his
son’s guardian; such a position
might have been painful to some
men—but love made everything
sweet; and he was happy in having
always had the entire confidence of
his beloved clients. He even referred
to the honoured husband of
the Queen, as in something of a
similar position to his own, and
brought down storms of applause.
Charley made his little speech with
great difficulty after his stepfather.
The poor boy looked ghastly, and
could scarcely get the words out;
but his pleased retainers, who believed
him overwhelmed by his
feelings, applauded all the same.
When he had done what was required
of him, Charley managed to
steal away unperceived by anybody
except Loo, who went wistfully
after her brother. She overtook
him by the time he had got to the
woods which skirted the park, and
put her arm softly within his without
saying anything. The two
young creatures wandered under
the bristling budded trees in silence,
with unspeakable sadness in
their hearts. They had nothing to
say to console each other—or rather
Loo, whose very heart wept over her
brother, could think of nothing to
say to him. At last, caressing his arm
with her tender, timid, little hand,
Loo ventured upon one suggestion:
“Oh, Charley, poor mamma!” said
the girl, in her heart-breaking young
voice. “Yes—poor mamma!” said
Charley, with a groan. Poor Mary!
it was all her doing, yet her children
cast no reproach upon her.
She, after all, would be the greatest
sufferer.</p>

<p class='c009'>“But, Loo, I can’t stop here
after what has happened,” said
Charley when they had both recovered
a little; “he may be going
to do everything that’s right for
anything we can tell. Don’t let us
talk as if it were anybody’s fault;
but I can’t stop here, you know,
about Fontanel, doing nothing, as
if—— Don’t cry, Loo. You would
not like, anyhow, to have an idle
fellow for a brother. Harry is the
clever one; but I daresay my godfather,
the old general, could get
me a commission; and I could live
on my pay,” said Charley, with a
slight quiver in his upper lip, “and
perhaps get on. I don’t think I
should make a bad soldier—only
that there’s the examinations, and
all that. It’s very hard, Loo, to
have lost all this time.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, Charley, Charley dear! I
can’t bear it—it’s too hard to put
up with,” cried poor little passionate
Loo.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now don’t you go and take
away what little strength a fellow
has,” remonstrated Charley; “it
must be put up with, and what’s
the use of talking? Now look here,
Loo; if you make a fuss, it will
do no good in the world, but only
vex mamma; she can’t mend it,
you know. I mean to put the best
face on it, and say I want to see
the world, and that sort of thing;
and believe exactly as if—as if the
fire had never happened,” said
Charley, with a dark momentary
cloud upon his face. “I can make
my mother believe me; and it will
be a comfort to her to have me out
of the way,” said the heroic lad,
with something like a suppressed
sob, “and to think I don’t suspect
anything. It <em>is</em> hard—I don’t say
anything else; but, Loo, we must
bear it all the same.”</p>

<p class='c009'>And so they went wandering
through the bare woods, poor Loo
stooping now and then unawares
to gather some violets according to
her girlish habits, and Charley,
even in the depths of his distress,
following with his eye the startled
squirrel running along a branch.
They were profoundly, forlornly,
exquisitely sad, but they could not
ignore the alleviations of their
youth. Amid all the sudden shock of
this disinheritance—in which there
mingled so cruel a sense of wrong,
so warm an indignation and resentment—Charley
still thought, with a
rising thrill of courage and pride,
that he might carve out for himself
a better fortune; while Loo,
her brother’s sole confidante and
supporter, was herself supported
by that exquisite consciousness of
being able to console and encourage
him, which almost atones to a girl’s
heart for every misfortune. They
could hear the distant echoes of
the cheers and laughter and loud
cordial talk of the guests, while
they strayed along silent, with
hearts too full to speak. Very
different anticipations had the two
entertained of this famous day so
long looked forward to. They were
to be the first in all the rejoicings
undertaken in their honour—for
the glory of the heir-apparent could
not fail to be shared by the Princess
Royal, the eldest daughter of
Fontanel; they had pictured to
themselves a brilliant momentary
escape out of the embarrassments
and restraints which they could not
but be conscious of at home, and
Charley had even been prepared to
feel magnanimous to Mr Summerhayes,
who, after all, was but a temporary
interloper, and had no right
to that inheritance of which the
young Clifford was heir indisputable.
Now, the sound of the merrymaking
went to Charley’s heart
with acute blows of anguish. It
was an aggravation of the sudden
misery, cold-blooded and odious;
what were they rejoicing about?
Because a poor boy had come to the
coveted years of manhood, to learn
bitterly, on the eve of what should
have been his triumph, that he was
an absolute dependant, a beggar, at
the mercy of a stepfather. No
wonder he could not speak; no
wonder he put up his hands to his
ears, and uttered a groan of rage and
wretchedness when that burst of
cheering came upon the wind, and
Loo, speechless, could but cry and
clench her little hands in the bitterness
of her heart. This was between
the tenants’ dinner and the
ball in the evening, which was to
be the gayest ever known in the
county. Poor Charley would gladly
have faced a tiger, or led a forlorn
hope, could he have had such an
alternative, instead of arraying himself
in sumptuous raiment and appearing
at that ball, where his presence
would be indispensable. He
seized poor Loo’s little hands
harshly in his own, and pressed
them till she could have screamed
for pain. “Don’t cry; your eyes
will be red at the ball—your first
ball, Loo!” cried her brother, with a
kind of savage tenderness; and Loo,
half afraid of this strange new development
of the man out of the
boy, was fain to dry her poor eyes
and cling to his arm, and coax him
to go in to prepare for the greater
trial of the night.</p>

<p class='c009'>While these two forlorn young
creatures were thus engaged, another
conversation was taking place
at a distance from the scene of the
festivities, in the park of Fontanel.
Mr Courtenay Gateshead had come
down to be present at the tenants’
dinner in his capacity as legal adviser
to Mr Summerhayes; but the
young lawyer looked on with a preoccupied
air, sometimes casting a
keen look of inspection at the master
of the feast. When the party
from the great house left the humble
revellers, Courtenay, instead of
joining Mr Summerhayes, beckoned
aside his uncle and partner. Old
Gateshead had stayed for the children’s
sake; but had found it totally
impossible to change Mr Summerhayes’s
first determination. He
would not consent to read, much
less to sign the document hastily
prepared by the anxious old lawyer.
He would think it over, he repeated,
and see Courtenay, with an implied
slight upon the powers and skill of
Courtenay’s uncle, which galled the
old man to the last degree. The
young lawyer found his relative exceedingly
sulky and out of temper.
“I have something particular to
consult you about,” Courtenay said,
who did not yet know anything
about the destruction of the deed;
and Mr Gateshead, who had that
disclosure to make, followed him
with no very pleasant feelings to
the verge of the wood, not very far
from where Charley and Loo were
wandering in the despair of their
hearts. But the old lawyer was
much taken by surprise by the
question which his nephew did not
put to him till they were quite
alone, and sheltered from all eavesdroppers
by the broad expanse of
the park.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Uncle, you have a wonderful
memory. I suppose you remember
John Clifford, this boy’s grandfather—he
who broke the entail,”
said Courtenay, in rather a hurried
voice.</p>

<p class='c009'>“John Clifford—what on earth
has he got to do with it?” cried
old Gateshead, whose memory was
wonderful, but whose powers of
comprehension were not equally
vivid.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, nothing, I daresay,” said
his nephew. “I want to know
what you recollect about him, that’s
all—he who joined his father in
breaking the entail——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“A very silly thing to do, Courtenay—a
fatal thing to do. Good
Lord, only think what a different
position these poor children might
have been in!” cried old Gateshead.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, yes—to be sure; but do
you recollect anything about John?”
said the young man.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I recollect everything about
him,” said the uncle. “Though he
was Harry Clifford’s father, and
they are both dead ages ago, he
was no older than I am. I think
we were born in the same
year——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“The same year? and you are
seventy; that must have been ‘87.
Was it ‘87, uncle? how can we
make sure?” said young Courtenay.
“I must hunt up the register of
baptisms to-morrow.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ah! I remember some talk about
that,” said the old lawyer. “The
parish books were burned once,
and the entry couldn’t be found.
There was some talk about it at the
time. Burned! I suppose you
don’t know what’s happened in
this fire? Oh! you’ll hear, you’ll
hear quite soon enough. But what
has John Clifford’s name come up
about now?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s something rather important
for Summerhayes—he looks in
wonderful force to-day,” said Courtenay;
“but if this should turn
out true he will soon sing small
enough. I may as well tell you at
once, uncle, for I am almost sure
about it. My impression is, that
the entail was never legally broken;
and, consequently, that Mr Clifford
had no more right than I have to
leave the property to his wife.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Old Gateshead looked at his
nephew with a stupified air. “The
entail was never broken?” he repeated
vacantly, looking in the
other’s face.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No—the entail was never legally
broken,” said Courtenay, with
the impatience of an acute and
rapid intelligence. “The thing
caught my attention some time ago,
but I would not speak of it till
I had worked it out. John Clifford—listen
uncle—executed the
papers with his father in the year
1806; and, if I am correct, he was
then an infant, and incapable
of doing anything of the sort. I
don’t believe he came of age till
1807. By Jove! what’s the matter?
the old man’s mad!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, Courtenay, the old man’s
not mad,” said his uncle. “Hurrah!
God save the Queen! Hurrah! why
don’t you help them to shout, you
cold-blooded young prig? I tell
you the boy’s saved. Hurrah, and
long life to him!” said old Gateshead,
waving his hat frantically,
and echoing with the wildest shrill
enthusiasm the distant cheers from
the tent. “I declare to you these
cheers choked me an hour ago,”
cried the old lawyer; “there’s things
a man can’t do even when he’s
an attorney. Courtenay, I say,
shake hands. You’re a disgusting
young prig, and you’re a deal too
clever for my practice; but if you
make it out, I’ll give in to you all
my life. Good Lord, that’s news!
tell me all about it. We’ve got a
sharp one to deal with; we’ll have
to make very sure, very sure. Let’s
hear every step how you came to
find it out.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Which Courtenay accordingly did,
and made it perfectly clear to
the anxious listener. Charley’s
grandfather had been in the unpleasant
predicament of having no
public legal record of his age; but
fifty years after the occurrence of
that fortunate mistake, scraps of
documents had turned up in the
hands of the family solicitor, depositaries
for generations of the family
secrets and difficulties, which
made it easy to establish, not by
one distinct statement, but by
many concurring scraps of evidence,
the exact date of John Clifford’s
birth; and to prove, as the young
lawyer was now prepared to do,
that the entail had never been
legally broken; that all the acts of
the last two reigns were founded
on a mistake; that, consequently,
Squire Henry’s will, in so far as it
related to the estate of Fontanel,
was null and void, and Charley was
no longer heir but <em>bona fide</em> proprietor
of the lands of the Cliffords.
Wonderful news—more than ever
wonderful that day.</p>

<p class='c009'>When Mr Courtenay Gateshead
sought Mr Summerhayes to break to
him this startling intelligence, the
elder lawyer went to find the mistress
of Fontanel, who was reposing
in her dressing-room, to prepare
for the exertions of the evening.
Poor Mary was in a very doubtful
state of mind that day. She had
wept for delight and gratitude when
she heard her husband’s speech to
the farmers; but when she came
to be by herself again, that enthusiastic
impression wore off, and the
fact came back to her, striking chill
to her heart—the fact that her children
were now at the stepfather’s
mercy, and that poor Charley, the
heir, was no longer the heir unless
another man pleased. Alas! poor
Mary knew now, to the bottom of
her heart, that it was another man—a
man who, though she was his
wife, did not, and could not, look
on Charley Clifford as his son. She
knew nothing about law, nor that
the deed, though destroyed, might
yet in its ashes form foundation
enough for any amount of lawsuits.
It <em>was</em> destroyed, and she had no
longer any power, and everything
was in Mr Summerhayes’s hands—that
was enough to quench the light
out of the very skies to the poor
mother. She dared not say to herself
what she feared, nor what she
thought he would do; she only
felt that he had the power, and that
Charley was at his mercy—and behind
all, bitterest of all, that it was
her fault. She was sitting resting,
in a kind of heavy gloom and stupor,
with her head buried in her
hands, feeling to her heart that she
was avoided by her children, and
that this day of triumph was to
them a day of mockery, when Mr
Gateshead’s message was brought
her. He was a very old friend, and
her first thought was that he had
at last prevailed on Mr Summerhayes
to consent to the new deed.
She got up in eager haste, and sent
her maid to bring him up-stairs.
She received the old man there, in
that room where her children no
longer came as of old. The result
was, not very long after, a hurried
ringing of bells, and messengers
running everywhere for Miss Loo,
who was just then coming in, dark
and pale from the woods, a very
woe-begone little figure in her holiday
dress. Poor Mary, overcome by
a hundred emotions which she did
not dare to tell, had fainted almost
in old Gateshead’s arms, to the
great dismay of the old lawyer. It
was deliverance to her boy, but it
was utter humiliation and downfall
to her husband. In the struggle of
sudden joy, confusion, and pain,
her senses and her mind gave way
for the moment. Loo rushing in,
vaguely aware that something had
happened which was well for
Charley, believed for the moment,
in an overwhelming revulsion of
remorse and repentance, that all
was henceforward to be ill for ever,
and that her mother was dead. But
Mary was not dead. She recovered
to appear at the ball—very gracious
and sweet, as was her wont, but
paler than anybody had ever seen
her before, as was remarked everywhere.
It was a pretty ball, every
body allowed; but the family looked
more <em>distrait</em> and strange than
any family, even under such an
infliction, had ever been seen to
look. Charley, who had most command
of himself after his mother,
was doing everything a young man
could do to keep his partners amused
and the crowd occupied; but
even Charley now and then grew
abstracted, and forgot himself for a
moment. As for Loo, though it
was her first ball, and her brown
eyes were splendid in the changeable
light that quivered in their
depths, she kept behind her mother
with a look of fright and timidity,
at which many a more experienced
young lady sneered openly; while
Mrs Summerhayes, moving about
among her guests with all her usual
sweetness, in her mature beauty,
could be seen sometimes to give
strange wistful looks aside to where
her husband stood, mostly in company
with Courtenay Gateshead.
Mary was pale, but Mr Summerhayes
was flushed and strange to
look upon. He said, in his gentlemanly
way, that the ball was his
wife’s business, and that he did not
pretend to be able to help Mrs
Summerhayes. He kept aloof from
her and from her children, clinging,
as it seemed, to young Gateshead.
There had been a fire to be sure,
but a fire only in the west wing,
where nothing particular could have
happened. What could it be? for
the county people were all quick
to perceive that something unusual
was in the air—at least the ladies
did, and did not fail to communicate
their suspicions. There must
have been a family quarrel, the
more acute imagined; and Miss
Laura and Miss Lydia Summerhayes,
whom their brother dismissed
summarily when they attempted
sisterly investigations, were fain to
make forlorn attempts to discover
from Loo what it was. The master
of the house had never been seen
to speak or look at any of the
family all the evening, till the principal
guests were in the supper-room,
all wondering, as they discussed
the good things there, what
could be the matter. Charley had
got in debt at the university—Charley
had formed some unsuitable
connexion—and his stepfather
was hard upon him. Thus the company
speculated; but the company
held its breath when Mr Summerhayes
laid his hand on Charley’s
shoulder, and solved the wonder of
the evening in the strangest, most unexpected
manner—to nobody so unexpected
as to his bewildered wife.</p>

<p class='c009'>“My friends,” said Mr Summerhayes,
in his gentlemanly way (and
it must be allowed that, whatever
were his faults, Tom Summerhayes
always was a gentleman), “we drank
this boy’s health to-day as the heir
of Fontanel; but since then something
has happened which has
excited us all considerably, as I
daresay you will have perceived;
and I have to tell you that Charley
is not only the heir, but the master
of this house. I am sure,” continued
Mr Summerhayes, leaning
his arm more heavily upon the
shoulder of the astonished youth,
“there never was a more hopeful
or promising beginning than he
will make, and I know he will have
all your good wishes. The fact is
that the property became my wife’s
under a mistake: the entail was
supposed to have been broken,
which turns out not to have been
the case; and it is an additional
pleasure to us,” said Mary’s husband,
turning round with a smile
to meet her look, which was fixed
upon him, and then leisurely surveying
the amazed assembly—“it is
a great additional pleasure to us,”
continued Mr Summerhayes, “to
find ourselves entitled, on a day
every way so happy, to give up our
laborious stewardship, and put our
boy in possession of his own. I
ask you over again, my excellent
friends and neighbours, to drink
the health of Charles Clifford of
Fontanel.”</p>

<p class='c009'>It was thus that Mr Summerhayes
extricated himself from his
false position. The cheers which
disturbed all the loiterers in the
ball-room, and brought them in a
crowd to see what it was, were
more for the retiring monarch than
the new sovereign. Charley himself,
in a warm revulsion of his generous
heart, had seized both his stepfather’s
hands, and wrung them
with strenuous gratitude. “I will
never forget your generosity,” cried
the eager boy, who would have
made over Fontanel there and then
had Summerhayes pleased, into his
keeping over again. Charley knew
nothing of the stormy scene with
Courtenay—the silent rage and
mortification which had thrown off
Mary’s attempts at consolation before
necessity and his better genius
warned Mr Summerhayes of this
opportunity left him for a graceful
retreat. Charley did not know, nor
the world—and the few who did
know had no wish to remember.
The whole party was in a flutter of
admiration; and poor Miss Laura
and Miss Lydia did all but go into
hysterics between horror at the
catastrophe and pride in their
brother. Never before had Mr
Summerhayes of the Manor taken
so high a position before the county
as that night when he gave up possession
of Fontanel.</p>

<h3 class='c019'>CHAPTER XI.—MRS SUMMERHAYES.</h3>

<p class='c018'>“It is not to be expected she can
like it much; but she is a good
little woman—she always was a
dear little woman,” said the Rector;
“and Mary’s jointure will make a
great deal of difference in the
manor-house, and smooth things
down considerably. She has been
doing all kinds of upholstery there
already.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“By Jove, I knew how it would
be!” said Major Aldborough; “I
told you all how it would be. I
said they’d kill him. He may
think he’s got off very easily, in my
opinion—cure him of meddling
with other people’s children as long
as he lives. What the deuce did
he want at Fontanel? a great deal
better to make himself snug, as I
suppose he means to do now, at
Summerhayes.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mary will drive down looking
just as bright as ever,” said Miss
Amelia Harwood. “I always said
she deserved to be happy, poor soul—she
always makes the best of
everything. Her heart was breaking
that night of Charley’s birthday.
I heard for a certain fact that she
fainted just before the ball—a thing
I never heard of Mary doing before.
Heaven knows what all she was
afraid of; there was something very
mysterious about that fire; but
now, you know, she has recovered
her spirits and her colour, and looks
just as she used to look. I shouldn’t
wonder a bit if she began life over
again, and was quite happy in the
manor-house now Tom Summerhayes
is coming home.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And so she ought to be, Amelia,”
said good Miss Harwood. “I am
sure she has many a poor woman’s
prayers.”</p>

<p class='c009'>All these good people were walking
on the Fontanel road. It was a
lovely evening in the early summer,
more than a year after Charley
Clifford’s birthday. Though it was
rather beyond the usual limits of
Miss Harwood’s walk, she was here
leaning on Miss Amelia’s arm to
enjoy the air, and to look for somebody
who was expected. The
Rector had strolled out on the same
errand; and that, or something similar,
had also drawn Major Aldborough
from his after-dinner repose.
The old-fashioned gates of
the Manor-house were open, and
some expectation was visible within.
Miss Laura and Miss Lydia, in very
summery muslin dresses, were to be
seen promenading before the house,
and hastened out, when they saw
the Miss Harwoods, to join their
friends.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It is very trying for us,” said
Miss Laura. “Oh, Miss Harwood,
it is a very trying occasion; not
that our new house is not very
nice and everything very comfortable;
but it is very very trying to
us,” said Miss Lydia, joining in;
“and oh, on dear Tom’s part, such
an unexpected change.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Your brother is expected home
to-morrow, Miss Laura?” said the
Rector.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, to-morrow,” answered Miss
Lydia, whose turn it was. “Poor
dear Tom is so fond of travelling
on the Continent, it is so good for
his health; and Mrs Summerhayes
wishes to be at home to receive
him. Lydia and I are so glad, and
yet we are sorry,” chimed in Miss
Laura; “it will be such a change
for dear Tom.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Not nearly so great a change
as for poor Mary,” said Miss
Amelia, “leaving her children,
poor soul; but I daresay she won’t
complain, and it must be better for
all parties to have it settled. And
so you like your new house? I am
told that Mary did all the furnishing
herself.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh yes, she is very kind,” said
Miss Laura; “she has made everything
very nice; you must come
and see it. Indeed, if it were not for
thinking what a change it is for
dear Tom,” cried the sisters both
together, with an evident impression
that their brother had been
defrauded of something he had a
right to, “we should all be very
happy; for dear Mary,” said Miss
Lydia, with a little sob, “is very
kind—and look, here she comes.”</p>

<p class='c009'>She came driving the pony-carriage,
as she had appeared so often
at Summerhayes. Poor Mary! if
she had been a wiser woman would
she have been loved as well? She
came, all beaming, with the smile
on her lip and the tear in her eye—courageous,
affectionate, sweet as
ever. Charley and Loo had ridden
down with her till they came in
sight of Summerhayes, and then
had taken leave of their mother.
Mary, with little Mary by her side
in the pony-carriage, drove on to
her separate fate alone. She was
going to take possession of the old
Manor-house, no longer the mistress
of Fontanel but Tom Summerhayes’s
wife, to receive him when he
came home from his travels, and to
make life bright, if he were capable
of seeing it, to that imperfect and
not very worthy man. The agitation
in her face was only enough
to heighten a little her sweet colour
and brighten her tearful eyes. On
the whole had she not great reason
to be happy? She had forgotten
everything but her husband’s virtues
while he had been absent, and her
children were safe and prosperous
and close at hand. She smothered
the little pang in her heart at parting,
and said to little Mary, with
a smile, that she would have had
to part with them all the same
when they were married. So the
mother and the daughter drove down
through the soft twilight and the
dews to the Manor, not without
brightness and good hope; while
Charley and Loo rode away towards
the darkening east, with a deeper
shadow on their young faces, not
quite sure how their home would
look when their mother was away.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mary stopped her ponies when
she saw the little procession which
had come out to meet her; the tears
came into her bright eyes again.
“It is so kind of you all,” she said,
kissing her hand to good Miss Harwood,
“and it is so pleasant to
think I can see you oftener now.”
“God bless you, my dear!” said the
two old ladies who had come for
love. And Mary said “Amen, and
the children too;” and so drove her
ponies cheerfully, with smiles and
tears, in through the open gates.</p>

<p class='c009'>Where, however, we will not follow
Mrs Summerhayes. Things had
turned out a great deal better than
could have been expected. Mr Summerhayes
was a man of the world,
and knew how to make a virtue of
necessity. He had given in gracefully
and at once, and gained reputation
thereby, nobody knowing
what his private feelings were when
Courtenay Gateshead’s discovery
came first upon his own widely-different
plans. The fire in the
west wing never was explained—nobody,
indeed, inquired very deeply
into it—and Mary, for her part, forgot
it, or associated it only with
old Gateshead’s nightcap, to which,
she remained firmly convinced, the
old man had set fire on his way to
bed. The fire at Fontanel was indeed
associated with old Mr Gateshead
throughout the county, as
was indeed a natural and perhaps
correct supposition. Anyhow,
nothing but the destruction of the
west wing had resulted from it, and
that was rather an improvement
than otherwise to the old place, in
which Loo, till they were both married,
was to keep house for her brother.
Little Mary, who was easy in
her temper and happy as the day
was long, went with Mrs Summerhayes
to the Manor—and Alf and
Harry were to have two homes for
their holidays. When Tom Summerhayes
came home next day, he
thought some fairy change had
come over the manor-house, and
forgave his wife with magnanimity
for all the trouble she had brought
upon him. Mary accepted the pardon
with gratitude, and Miss Laura
and Miss Lydia thought Tom a
hero; and so, with a tolerable amount
of content on all sides, life began
over again for the reunited couple.
Mary had her own troubles still, like
most people; but perhaps had not
been much more happy as Mrs
Clifford than she was as Mrs Summerhayes.</p>

  <h2 class='c002'>SIR JAMES GRAHAM.<a id='r2'></a><a href='#f2' class='c007'><sup>[2]</sup></a></h2>
</div>

<div class='footnote' id='f2'>
<p class='c008'><a href='#r2'>2</a>. ‘The Life and Times of Sir James R. G. Graham, Bart., G.C.B., M.P.’  By
Torrens M’Cullagh Torrens. In 2 vols. London: Saunders &#38; Otley.</p>
</div>

<p class='c009'>These are not exactly the sort
of volumes which we could have
wished them to be. Sir James
Graham, though never a foremost,
was still a remarkable man in his
age, and doubtless left behind, in
his correspondence, and in the memories
of his friends, better materials
than we find here for an
elaborate biography. Still, let us
do justice to Mr M’Cullagh Torrens.
If family archives have not
been unlocked to him, and private
friends abstained from telling
him more than they could help, he
has made very good use of stores
which were open to all the world,
and strung together, with considerable
skill, his scraps of past history.
The result is a book which will be
much and approvingly read; though
we cannot anticipate that it will
fire the imagination or touch the
feelings of any human being.</p>

<p class='c009'>The family from which Sir James
Graham derived his descent is of
long standing in the “debatable
land.” Its founder seems to have
been “John with the bright
sword,” a son of Malise, Lord of
Menteith, whom a quarrel with the
Scottish King induced, in the beginning
of the fifteenth century, to
migrate beyond the Scottish border.
Carrying with him a band of
stout retainers, he soon acquired a
settlement there, and became by-and-by
the boldest and most successful
of the moss-troopers, whose
custom it was to harry indifferently
the lands of the two kingdoms.</p>

<p class='c009'>The descendants of John gradually
extended their influence and
enlarged their possessions. Between
the Esk and the Eden, and
for some miles to the north of the
Esk, there lies a district which,
till the Partition Treaty of 1552,
may be said to have belonged
neither to England nor to Scotland.
It was there that the Græmes
settled, and there, in spite of many
a harsh decree issued against them
from both realms, they grew and
prospered. And finally, when peaceable
times came, they were recognised
as large landed proprietors,
and useful members of the
English community.</p>

<p class='c009'>The first politician in the family
appears to have been Sir Richard
Græme, who, after acting as Master
of the Horse to the Duke of Buckingham,
was taken up and enriched
by grants from the Crown. He it
was who acquired by purchase
Netherby Hall, with various manors
lying contiguous to it. Espousing
the cause of his master in the civil
wars, and following him to the
field, he was severely wounded at
the battle of Edgehill; yet he contrived,
malignant as he was, to keep
his estates together, though not
without heavy fines imposed upon
them by Cromwell.</p>

<p class='c009'>The immediate successor of the
first baronet led a quiet life, and
died in his bed. His grandson was
more ambitious. He made some
figure in Parliament, and was in
1682 created Viscount Preston in
the peerage of Scotland. This did
not oblige him to retire from the
English House of Commons, in
which he sat as Knight of the Shire
for Cumberland; and he ultimately,
after serving as ambassador
in Paris, took office as Secretary
of State under James II. Lord
Preston would never stoop to pay
court to William III. He even
accepted from James, after his expulsion
from the throne, a patent
of English nobility, which he pleaded
in bar of trial before a common
jury, when charged with conspiring
to bring back the exiled family.
The House of Lords, however,
would not acknowledge the patent,
and the evidence against Lord Preston
proved too strong to be rebutted.
He was found guilty, and sentence
of death was passed upon him,
with attainder of his peerage and
forfeiture of his property.  It is
creditable to the memory of Dutch
William that he refused to carry the
sentence into execution. Enough
of blood had been shed on the scaffold;
and the King, though strongly
pressed by some of the leading
Whigs to let the law take its course,
adhered to his own determination.
Lord Preston’s daughter, it appears,
was one of Queen Mary’s attendants.
The Queen found her one
day gazing at the picture of James
II., and weeping bitterly; and desiring
to be told why the maiden
wept, she received this answer: “I
am thinking how hard it is that my
father should suffer death because
he loved your father.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Preston’s pardon alarmed the
Jacobites as much as it disgusted
and offended the Whigs. The former
not unnaturally came to the conclusion
that he must have betrayed
them. The latter, especially Bishop
Burnet, himself the meanest and
basest of intriguers, clamoured
against the act of clemency, as if
some wrong had been done personally
to themselves. Both parties
were, however, in error. Preston
had not been many months at liberty
before he was again arrested
and sent to the Tower as a traitor;
and though fortunate enough in
the present instance to show that
the charge against him was groundless,
his health sank under disquiet
of mind, and he died soon after his
release.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Scotch peerage became extinct
in the third generation from
this, and the estates went to two
sisters, one married to Lord Widrington,
the other single. On the
death of the unmarried sister, the
whole of the property came to Lady
Widrington—a fortunate circumstance
for her lord, for he, like his
father-in-law, was a stanch Jacobite,
and took the field against the
established Government in 1715.
He escaped with his life after the
failure of the enterprise, but found
himself landless and a beggar.
Happily the law would not allow
Lady Widrington’s possessions to
be interfered with, and she was
thus enabled to afford Lord Widrington
an adequate maintenance
during the remainder of his life.
Finally, Lady Widrington, dying
childless, left the Netherby estates
to a first cousin, the Rev. Robert
Graham, D.D., second son of the
Dean of Carlisle. From him,
through his second son, the subject
of our present sketch was descended.</p>

<p class='c009'>Dr Graham was a great improver.
Immediately on succeeding
to the property, he set himself
to drain the lands, clear out mosses,
build decent houses for his tenantry,
and gradually to raise their
rents. He built also, or rather rebuilt,
Netherby Hall, carefully collecting
and depositing in a room
set apart to receive them, the many
relics of Roman art which were
discovered in digging the foundation.
Like improvers in general,
however, he worked rather for posterity
than for himself; and he
not unnaturally desired that with
their enlarged resources the family
should recover the baronetage,
which, for lack of heirs-male, had
become extinct. His wish in regard
to this matter was accomplished,
though neither in his own
person nor in that of his eldest son.
The latter, by name Charles, survived
his father barely a fortnight;
and as Charles’s only child happened
to be a daughter, the estate, strictly
entailed on heirs-male, passed to his
younger brother James.</p>

<p class='c009'>There had never been a Whig
in the Graham family till the Doctor
professed Whiggish principles.
Then, as now, the Whigs took better
care of their friends than the
Tories; and as they came into
power within a month of Dr
Graham’s death, Dr Graham’s son
received immediate proof that his
father’s services were not forgotten.
He was created a baronet, and
gave, of course, his political support
to Fox and his friends. But before
the year 1782 was out, Fox made
way at the Exchequer for Pitt, and
such a breaking up and reconstruction
of parties ensued as might
have easily perplexed men of
stronger minds than Sir James
Graham. The result was, that,
after some wavering, Sir James
attached himself to the great Minister,
and continued to the end of
his days a stanch Tory in the
sense which Mr Pitt and the best
of Pitt’s friends were accustomed
to apply to the term.</p>

<p class='c009'>In 1785 Sir James Graham married
Lady Catherine Stuart, the
eldest daughter of John, seventh
Earl of Galloway. Remarkable
for her personal attractions, Lady
Catherine was gifted at the same
time with an excellent understanding
and a very genial nature. A
little rigid she seems to have been
in her religious opinions; a great
friend, for example, of Dean Milner,
the author of a Church History of
which it has been justly observed,
that in seeking to achieve an impossible
object it effected nothing.
Her Calvinistic tendencies, however,
never interfered with the exercise
of a large and widely-extended
benevolence. Neither were her
prejudices so rooted as to stand in
the way of more worldly friendships.
Archdeacon Paley, certainly
not religious over-much, found a
ready and frequent welcome at
Netherby. So did Dr Vernon, the
Bishop of Carlisle, whose great
idea of Episcopal dignity was to
maintain as strict a discipline
among his clergy as the temper
of the times would admit, and to
dispense a generous hospitality at
Rose Castle. Thus, the geniality
of the laird and the high religious
temperament of the lady worked
well together, and Netherby Hall
became, under their united influence,
the centre of everything that
was kind and good in the social intercourse
of the neighbourhood.</p>

<p class='c009'>Sir James Graham the first married
early. He was barely twenty-two,
and Lady Catherine twenty,
when they came together, and a
large family followed. Daughters
arrived first, and by-and-by, on the
1st of June 1792, their eldest son
was born.  Great rejoicings took
place on that occasion, and the
child was named at his baptism
James Robert George—James,
after his father; Robert, after his
paternal grandfather; and George,
in memory of the man among his ancestors
who had least claim to the
distinction, his only merit having
been this, that in difficult times
he exercised great prudence, and
managed, in consequence, to keep
himself from getting into trouble.
Young James’s early education
seems to have been conducted at
home, though how, we are not told.
But in 1802 he was sent with his
brother William to a private school
at Dalston, a village of which the
Rev. Walter Fletcher, Chancellor
of the Diocese, was the incumbent.</p>

<p class='c009'>At Mr Fletcher’s school young
Graham failed to make the progress
in classics which his friends
expected from him. The previous
training afforded to him at Netherby
may perhaps account for this
circumstance. At ten years of age
he was already an expert angler
and a good shot, accomplishments
not to be despised in their proper
place, but scarcely conducive to
rapid advancement in the path of
early scholarship. Hence, when
removed to Westminster in 1806,
he cut but an indifferent figure
at entrance, and, though not idle,
never managed afterwards to take
a foremost place among his contemporaries.
It is fair to add that
the place which he did take was
always a respectable one. He quite
held his own against the late Duke
of Richmond, then Lord Charles
Lennox, to whom he was fag, and
suffered nothing in comparison with
the present Earl Russell, the occupant
with him of the same form.</p>

<p class='c009'>Westminster boys have always enjoyed
the privilege of admission to
the debates in the House of Commons;
and among them all, between
the years 1806 and 1809, none took
more frequent advantage of it than
young Graham. He came just in
time to listen to some of the last
speeches of Pitt and Fox, and to
be stirred by the scarcely less
exciting harangues of Windham,
Grattan, Sheridan, and Canning.
These, with Wilberforce’s persuasive
appeals against slavery, and
Romilly’s stern denunciations of
the cruelty of the penal code, took
a strong hold of his imagination.
He yearned for the time when he,
in like manner, might be able to
carry the House along with him,
and already determined that nothing
should on his part be wanting
to bring about the accomplishment
of the dream. It was the
memory of what he had himself
felt on such occasions, which induced
him, at one of the meetings
of the old Westminsters, to argue
as he did, with great force, against
the project for removing the school
into the country. No considerations
of physical health ought, in
his opinion, to be weighed against
the abandonment of an intellectual
impulse so powerful as was supplied
to the boys by their proximity to
the Houses of Parliament; and believing,
as we do, that the sanitary
drawbacks to Westminster where
it now stands are grossly exaggerated,
we believe also that Sir James
Graham took a wise and even a
benevolent view of the matter then
under discussion.</p>

<p class='c009'>In 1809 young Graham quitted
Westminster, and became a private
pupil in the family of the Rev. G.
Richards, Vicar of Bampton, near
Farringdon, in Berkshire. There
he made the acquaintance of Sir
John Throckmorton, one of the
most eminent agriculturists of the
day, and learned from him how
much was to be gained by the application
of science and capital to
the culture of the soil. His sojourn
in Bampton did not, however, extend
beyond a year. In 1810 he
entered as a gentleman-commoner
at Christ Church, and in 1812
quitted Oxford without having at
all distinguished himself there, or
even passed for a degree.</p>

<p class='c009'>It must not be supposed from all
this that Mr Graham was either an
idler or a dreamer. In his own way
he picked up a large amount of
knowledge. He was a good Latin
and a very fair Greek scholar. In
pure mathematics he never advanced
far, but he was rapid in calculation,
and possessed considerable
skill in the arrangement of his own
ideas. With all this, he was either
indifferent about academical honours,
or he disliked the order of
studies which led to them. In
private life he was somewhat reserved,
and what ill-natured people
might call stately. His style of
dress was in the extreme of fashion;
and being tall and well made, with
a countenance singularly handsome,
it is not to be wondered at if,
among casual acquaintances, he was
set down as a considerable coxcomb.
Nobody, however, could
lay to his charge that there was any
lack of manliness about him. His
vacations he usually spent in the
north, where he threw himself keenly
into field-sports, and was as forward
with the fox-hounds as he was
successful on the moor and by the
river-side. At the same time, his
desire to take an active part in the
war of politics never grew cold.
His father, a consistent supporter
of Mr Pitt, had sat in Parliament
as the Tory member for Ripon from
1802 to 1807. Mr Graham’s prejudices
were all on the other side;
a bias which they seem to have
acquired partly through the deference
in which he held the opinions
of his relative, Lord Archibald
Hamilton, partly because he met
at his father’s table not always the
most eloquent or well-instructed
advocates of Toryism. Be the
causes, however, what they might,
he gave himself up to the Whigs,
and in 1812 swore fealty to them,
by being admitted, on the recommendation
of Lord Morpeth, into
Brookes’s Club. It was too soon for
him as yet to aspire to a seat in the
House of Commons; he determined,
therefore, to devote a year or two
to foreign travel; and as the only
portion of the Continent then open
to British subjects was the Spanish
Peninsula, he set out with the intention
of visiting one after another
the principal seaports in Portugal
and Spain.</p>

<p class='c009'>Among these seaports there was
none which offered to him so many
attractions as Cadiz. It was there
that the Central Junta met, and
Graham not only became a frequent
auditor at its sittings, but formed
the personal acquaintance of some
of its most distinguished members.
The circumstance, however,
on which, in after years, he used
to dwell with the greatest delight,
was this—that in Cadiz he
received his first introduction to the
Duke of Wellington. That great
man, it will be remembered, in the
winter of 1812, repaired to Cadiz
for the purpose of entering with
the Spanish Government into arrangements,
to which the Spanish
Government never adhered. And
Mr Graham, being at the time the
guest of Sir Henry Wellesley, had
the gratification of conversing with
the British hero, not in public
only, but amid that entire unreserve
into which the Duke was apt to
throw himself when he felt or fancied
that he was among friends,
and could therefore give free and
safe utterance to his sentiments on
all subjects.</p>

<p class='c009'>From Cadiz Mr Graham proceeded
to Palermo, where Major-General
Lord Montgomery held a military
command. It will be recollected
that Sicily was then occupied by an
English army, and that Lord William
Bentinck, though absent at the
moment, was, properly speaking,
at the head of it. To Lord Montgomery,
however, besides his military
command, a high political
trust had been committed; and imagining
that he saw in Mr Graham a
remarkable aptitude for business,
he offered to his acceptance the post
of private secretary. Nothing could
better fall in with the wishes of the
young tourist. He accepted the
office, and realised fully the expectations
of his patron, by whom he
was employed to manage an affair
requiring great delicacy as well as
firmness in handling it. This was
nothing less than to make his way
through the heart of the French
armies, and to open a communication
first with Murat, and afterwards
with the Austrian Government.
It was while so employed
that Mr Graham became acquainted
with Sir Charles, then Captain
Napier, of the Euryalus frigate, of
whom he conceived a very high
opinion, and with whom, in due
course of time, he quarrelled violently.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mr Graham, after accompanying
Lord William Bentinck through
his campaign in Italy, returned to
England, and began, early in 1815,
to feel his way towards a seat in the
House of Commons. It was a season,
as a few of our readers may
possibly recollect, of great suffering
among the people, and anxiety to
the Government. The renewal of
the war with France added upwards
of one hundred millions to the national
debt; and peace, when it was
purchased by the battle of Waterloo,
seemed to bring only poverty in its
train. A spirit of general disaffection
pervaded the masses, and recourse
was had to stringent measures
in order to preserve the public
peace. Drawn away by old associations,
Mr Graham joined the ranks
of the ultra-Liberals. Lord Archibald
Hamilton was his kinsman,
and Lord Folkstone, Sir Francis
Burdett, and Lord Althorpe, won
his political affections. His father,
on the other hand, continued to
profess the Tory principles in which
he had grown old; so that, but for
the sympathy of Lady Catherine,
the young man might have found
himself ill at ease as an inmate
of Netherby Hall. Accordingly, he
spent but little of his time there
in the interval between his return
from abroad and the general election
of 1818; when, being assured
of the support of Lord Milton, and
obtaining through his mother letters
of recommendation to Mr Wilberforce,
he entered the lists as a candidate
for Hull, and fought a hard
battle to a successful issue.</p>

<p class='c009'>We confess not to hold the name
of William Wilberforce quite in the
same degree of veneration in which
it is held by his sons. We believe
that there was no slight sprinkling
of what is vulgarly called humbug
in the good man’s character; and
we find some corroboration of this
suspicion in the fact that, though
well aware of Mr Graham’s ultra-Liberal
opinions, he nevertheless,
because of the affection with which
he regarded Lady Catherine, recommended
her son to the constituency
of Hull. A like charge may, we
think, be brought against Dean
Milner, subject, of course, to extenuating
circumstances. Dean
Milner conscientiously believed that
the admission of Roman Catholics
to political power would be tantamount
to the establishment of idolatry
in Great Britain: yet he, too,
because Lady Catherine sat at his
feet, gave a testimonial to her son,
whom he knew to be an advocate
of Catholic emancipation. By these
means, and through the active
agency of two Roman Catholic
gentlemen and one clergyman of
the Church of England, Mr Graham
conducted his canvass with such
spirit, that on the day of nomination
an immense majority of hands
was held up in his favour; and
at the end of the second day’s polling
he was thirty-three ahead of
the gentleman whom he had determined
to oust, and whom he succeeded
in ousting. Those, however,
were times when polling went
on for fifteen consecutive days,
during which electors and their
friends lived at free quarters, candidates
paying the piper. When,
therefore, the returning-officer declared
that Mr Graham had beaten
Mr Stamford by thirty-eight votes,
and when Mr Stamford’s committee
thereupon demanded a scrutiny,
Mr Graham’s heart sank within
him. His father had with difficulty
been prevailed upon to sanction his
entering into the contest at all.
The funds at his disposal were quite
exhausted, and here was the battle
to be fought over again. But who,
having committed himself to such
a struggle, ever willingly withdrew
from it? Mr Graham did not; and
at the end of a month he was pronounced
member for Hull, with a
debt of £6000 hanging like a millstone
upon his back.</p>

<p class='c009'>The lesson thus taught him at
the outset of his career Mr Graham
never afterwards forgot. He was
fortunate enough to raise the money
at interest, without calling upon
his father for a shilling; but he
registered a vow to rush no more
blindfold into scrapes of the kind;
and he kept it, in spite of many a
strong inducement in after-times to
the contrary.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mr Graham took his seat on the
third Opposition bench, behind his
relative Lord Archibald Hamilton.
Near him sat Mr E. Ellice (the Bear),
Sir Robert Wilson, and Mr F. E.
Kennedy; below him, Sir Francis
Burdett, Mr Hume, and Lord Althorpe.
It was a goodly association,
and it produced its legitimate
results. The war of parties soon
began; and in March 1819, scarcely
a month after he had taken his
seat, the young member delivered
his maiden speech. It proved a
signal failure. Abounding in platitudes,
and spoken with the air and
in the tone of an exquisite, it
scarcely commanded the attention
of the House for a moment, and
was brought to a close amid that
buzz of general conversation which,
more surely than any violent outcry
of dissent, marks the disinclination
of the Commons of England to be
instructed. Mr Graham felt that
his shot had missed, yet he by no
means lost heart. He believed that
the causes of the failure might be
equally shared between himself and
the House, and he determined to
try again and again till he should
compel the attention which was
now denied him. Meanwhile, he
sought comfort under the disappointment
in a connection which
proved to be the source, to him, of
the purest happiness through life.
On the 8th of July 1819 he married
Fanny Callander, one of the loveliest
women whom England, fertile
in beauty, had ever produced. She
was the daughter of Colonel Sir
James Callander, afterwards Campbell
of Arkinglas, and the aunt, as
we need hardly stop to observe, of
the still beautiful and highly-gifted
Mrs Norton.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mr Graham’s next effort was
made during that eventful autumn
session when Parliament met in
consequence of the Peterloo affair,
and the Government demanded
powers beyond those of the constitution,
to deal with the dangers
which threatened the country. One
of the bills which Ministers proposed,
with a view to stop the organised
agitation which Radical
delegates kept up, prohibited all
persons, not resident in a town, or
being freeholders, from taking any
part in the proceedings of a town
meeting. Here was an opportunity
which the ambitious member for
Hull could not possibly allow to
escape. He rose to demand whether
the member for a borough, being
neither the inhabitant of such borough
nor a freeman, would come
within the meaning of the Act; and
when, to his great indignation, nobody
seemed inclined to reply, he
had the imprudence to argue the
case, and to state it as peculiarly his
own. Just at that moment a sound
of suppressed laughter was heard
in the House, whereupon the member
for Hull lost his head, and, after
rambling on for a few minutes
without a single cheer to sustain
him, sat down, retaining no recollection
either of what he had said,
or of what he meant to say.
“There’s an end of Graham,” exclaimed
Mr Henry Lascelles, jeeringly;
“we shall hear no more of
him.” But Mr Lascelles was mistaken.</p>

<p class='c009'>Nothing daunted by this discomfiture,
the baffled senator stood
up again when the bill went into
committee. This time he had carefully
prepared his speech, and the
House listened to it, without, however,
evincing any signs that it approved.
He was still on the losing
side in politics; and though his
friends saw that there was good
stuff in him, even they scarcely
ventured to hope that he would
ever prove more than a useful
second-rate orator, and a good man
of business whenever matters of
detail came to be considered.</p>

<p class='c009'>The death of George III. in February
1820 warned the House of
Commons that its days were numbered.
The Government was desirous
of precipitating the dissolution;
and the Opposition took, in
consequence, an early opportunity
to hamper them, as far as might be,
by a small reform bill. Lord John
Russell proposed that the writs for
Grampound, Penrhyn, Barnstaple,
and Camelford, should be suspended,
in order to afford the new Parliament
an opportunity of inquiring
into the corruption with which these
boroughs were charged. But Lord
John’s motion, which Mr Graham
supported, though successful in the
Lower House, was thrown out in
the Upper, and the members dispersed,
each to look after his own
interest as he best might.</p>

<p class='c009'>It would have been idle in Mr
Graham to offer himself again to
the constituency of Hull. He had
done nothing in Parliament to
secure a re-election, except at the
cost of a second contest, and that
he could not afford. The interest
of the debt incurred by the first
election pressed heavily upon his
small income, and he at once made
up his mind to look for a seat elsewhere.
Now the Lowther influence,
powerful as it had heretofore
been, was beginning to give way in
the north of England. Both the
county of Cumberland and the city
of Carlisle were growing restive, and
the Whigs declared their intention
of fighting for both seats in the
city, and for one at least in the
county. It was proposed to Mr
Graham that he should stand in
the Liberal interest for Carlisle;
while Mr Curwen, up to that time
the city member, contested the
county against Sir John Lowther.
Anxious as he was to return to the
House of Commons, Mr Graham
had the good taste to decline this
proposal. He could not fight under
a Whig banner so close to Netherby
without greatly distressing his
father; and, vaulting as his ambition
was, it did not blind him to the
impropriety of such a course. He
contented himself, therefore, with
throwing the weight of his influence
into Mr Curwen’s scale as candidate
for the county. Mr Curwen
succeeded, so did Mr John Cam
Hobhouse in Westminster, advocating
household suffrage, triennal
Parliaments, and counting among
the busiest of his canvassers the
late member for Hull. Mr Graham’s
activity on that occasion fixed upon
him the attention of certain gentlemen
connected by property with
the little borough of St Ives. They
took him up, he canvassed the constituency,
and on the day of election
was brought in at the head of the
poll. And well and zealously he
redeemed the pledges which he had
given to his Liberal supporters. He
voted with Mr Hume against a
proposed increase to the civil-list
of George IV., and for inquiry
into the expenses of the Regency
during the five preceding years.
He took part with Mr Brougham
in his attack on the droits of the
Crown and of the Admiralty, and
joined Lord John Russell in demanding
that the report on the
civil-list should be deferred till the
estimates for the year had been
fully examined. Every proposal, in
short, which had for its object the
weakening of the influence of the
Crown and the overthrow of existing
usages, received his cordial support.
He was, with Mr Curwen
and Mr Brougham, a decided enemy
to the Corn Laws as they then
existed. He went into the gallery
with Lord John Russell for the disfranchisement
of Grampound, and
the transfer of its members to
Leeds. In a like spirit, he stood
by Lord Archibald Hamilton when
denouncing the Scottish system of
election, and requiring that the
number of Barons of the Exchequer
should be reduced. Finally, in the
disputes which arose about Queen
Caroline, he ranged himself under
her Majesty’s banner. This was
pretty well within the brief interval
of less than a year, as indicating
the course which he had
determined to follow. But a check
came. The electors of St Ives were
not at all satisfied with their new
member. They presented a petition
early in 1821 against Mr Graham’s
return, and Mr Graham, rather than
incur the certain expense and hazard
of a scrutiny, resigned his seat.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mortified as he was at finding
himself thus excluded from public
life, Mr Graham possessed too good
a digestion to let the circumstance
prey upon his spirits. His home
was then, as it continued to be
to the last, the chief scene of his
happiness; and the birth of his
first-born son, on the 7th of April
1820, shed additional light over
the domestic circle. It suited
neither his means nor his tastes to
reside in London as an idler; he
therefore retired into Cumberland,
and, settling down at Crofthead, the
unpretending house to which he
had carried his beautiful bride, he
threw himself with all his energies
into country pursuits. It was high
time that he should. His father,
an easy-going and generous man,
had never looked after his affairs
as became him. He put himself
entirely into the hands of an
agent, from whom he exacted no
accounts, and who did with the
rents of the large estate of Netherby
pretty much as he pleased.
The consequence was that farms
and farm-buildings went to ruin.
Payments on account were all that
the landlord received, and tenants
got into arrear so far that recovery
was impossible. With some difficulty
Mr Graham prevailed upon
his father to transfer the management
of the property to him, and the
work of practical reform began. But
the extent of the difficulties with
which he had to grapple may be
guessed at, when we say that encumbrances
to the amount of not
less than £120,000 lay like a dead
weight upon Netherby.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mr Graham had accomplished a
good deal. Money was raised on
more favourable terms; roads were
made, marshes drained, farm-buildings
rendered habitable, and a better
system of tillage introduced, when,
in 1824, his father died, and he
succeeded to the title and to the
estate. An additional burden was
of course laid upon the latter in
the shape of dower to Lady Catherine,
but for the sisters of the new
proprietor scarcely any provision
had been made. Sir James, like a
good brother as he was, supplied
the deficiency out of his own
funds. But this done, there remained
so little on which to reckon,
more especially with his views of
extensive improvement, that he
thought seriously of selling Netherby,
and of embarking, with whatever
might remain to him after
paying off the mortgages, in trade.
He even went so far as to open a
negotiation with a London banking-house
which happened at that moment
to desire an extension of its
business, and waited only the judgment
of Mr James Evan Bailey of
Bristol, to whom, through a friend,
he referred the question. “Tell
him,” said that experienced banker,
“to hold fast by Netherby, and
keep clear of banking.” By Netherby
Sir James accordingly held fast,
and within twelve months the
names of Messrs Pole, Thornton,
Down, &#38; Co. appeared in the ‘Gazette.’</p>

<p class='c009'>It had been Sir James’s dream
that, as a banker or as a thriving
merchant, he would find readier access
to the political career on which
he desired to enter, than as the
owner of a large and encumbered
estate. The fate of Messrs Pole and
Thornton awoke him from that
dream, and he bent all his energies
to diminish, if he could not entirely
remove, the debt upon Netherby.
His own habits were prudent and
economical. He chose for his associates
practical agriculturists,
studied every work that came out
on the subject of agriculture, and
put in practice such suggestions as
appeared to be wise. He read, likewise,
with a view to prepare himself
at some future time for public life,
and read to excellent purpose. The
consequence was, that every year
saw the burden diminish which at
the outset seemed to be intolerable;
and that, in 1826, his circumstances,
if not easy, were at all events much
less harassing than at one moment
he had expected them ever to be.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was at this time that he first
came before the public as an author.
His pamphlet on corn and currency
made a great sensation, taking men
of all parties by surprise. Its argument
went far beyond the age in
which it appeared. Upon the Bank
Restriction Act of 1797 he laid
the blame of all the evils under
which the country then laboured,
and censured Mr Peel for returning
too hastily to cash payments in
1819. The sliding-scale, as a protection
to corn-growers, he entirely
condemned, and reasoned in favour
of free trade, with a small but fixed
duty on foreign corn as some compensation
for the peculiar burdens
which the land was called upon to
bear. We who read the pamphlet
now, remembering all that the country
has gone through, and looking
to the present state both of its
manufacturing and agricultural interests,
cannot sufficiently admire
the audacity of the country gentleman
who, in 1826, could thus express
himself. But his audacity
told. Though all the leaders of
party, from Lord Liverpool to Cobbet,
denounced and censured, there
were multitudes in the ranks who
approved the Cumberland baronet’s
reasoning, and no great while elapsed
ere they gave tangible proof of their
sympathy with his views.</p>

<p class='c009'>At the dissolution of Parliament
in 1826, Mr James, who for some
time had represented Carlisle, retired.
A requisition was immediately
sent in to Sir James Graham,
who replied to it favourably, and
came forward as the Liberal candidate.
We do not use the stronger
term Radical, because, to do him
justice, Sir James never voted for
universal suffrage and annual Parliaments;
but of everything on the
sinking-scale short of these two
points he was then the advocate.
He declared himself in favour of
the immediate abolition of slavery,
the total removal of religious disabilities,
retrenchment in the public
expenditure, and the reduction
within moderate limits of the import-duty
on corn. The struggle
was fierce both in Carlisle and elsewhere,
for the Catholic Question
was approaching a crisis; and Sir
James, supported by all the operatives
of the city, came in at the head
of the poll. His first vote in the
House was against the Government,
on a question of an increased grant
out of the Consolidated Fund to
the Duke and Duchess of Clarence;
his next, for an inquiry into the
abuses in the Court of Chancery.
On both occasions he went into the
lobby, one of a small minority. But
already prospects began to open for
him, on which he had no reason to
count in returning to public life.
Lord Liverpool was struck down by
paralysis in 1827, and that scramble
for a successor at the Treasury
began, of which, by the way, Mr
Torrens gives a very inaccurate account.
Following implicitly the
story told by Mr Stapleton, he endeavours
to show that Canning was
no intriguer; that George IV. hated
and would have set Canning aside,
had he seen his way to any other arrangement;
and that the Conyngham
influence had nothing in the
world to say in deciding the King’s
policy. We know better; and we
know likewise that not the Tories
only, but the most consistent and
stanchest of the Whigs never trusted
Canning. Sir James Graham, on the
other hand, ranged himself among
the Canningites, and soon became
the friend and favourite pupil of
Huskisson. He sat on the ministerial
side of the Speaker’s chair
while Canning led the House, and
he retained his place during the administration
which succeeded on
Canning’s demise. But Lord Goderich’s
reign was short; and on the
assumption of office by the Duke
of Wellington, Sir James withdrew
with his Whig allies to the Opposition
benches. His opposition,
however, appears to have been a
good deal modified by the esteem
in which he held Mr Huskisson.
The Corn Bill which that gentleman
introduced, still being a minister,
Sir James Graham supported,
though it was framed on a principle
at variance with that which
he had advocated in his pamphlet;
and many years elapsed ere he could
bring himself to contemplate without
alarm the disturbance of the
compromise into which, as he believed,
contending parties had entered
by its adoption.</p>

<p class='c009'>In 1827 a vacancy occurred in the
representation of Cumberland, and
Sir James was easily persuaded to
resign his seat for Carlisle and to
set up for the county. His return
was not opposed, and he entered
the House after a brief absence as a
county member. Though still ineffective
in debate, the House began
to consider him a man of promise.
He was an excellent member of
committees, assiduous in his attendance,
and remarkably skilful
in sifting evidence. He spoke
likewise with effect in moving for
an inquiry into the fitness of limiting
the circulation of Scotch notes
to Scotland itself; and his speech,
though overladen, as most of his
speeches were, with quotations, was
referred to by almost all who followed
him, whether advocating or
opposing the view which he took of
the matter. But his great start was
taken, when the Duke, by passing
his Catholic Relief Bill, gave the
first decided shock to the Tory
party. Sir James of course approved
the measure, of which, as
well as of the repeal of the Test
and Corporation Acts, he had always
been the consistent supporter.
And he did more. He took an
opportunity of commending Sir
Robert Peel, in his absence, for the
sacrifice to duty which he had made
of his seat for the University of
Oxford, and paved the way thereby
for the close intimacy which in due
time arose between him and that
great though not always straightforward
or very consistent statesman.</p>

<p class='c009'>Whatever the Duke’s conduct
and views at that critical moment
may have been, those of his subordinates
strike us now as not only
impolitic, but dishonest. Sir George
Murray went out of his way to assure
the Whigs that he intended to
manage the affairs of the colonies
on the principles which they advocated.
Sir Henry Hardinge became
a frequent visitor at Spenser
House, and professed opinions
there which led Lord Althorpe to
reckon upon him as a willing member
of a new coalition. Meanwhile
three members of Brookes’s, Lords
Rosselyn and Jersey and Sir James
Scarlett, held office under a Tory
chief, and Earl Grey was approached
with a view to conciliation by creating
his son-in-law, Mr Lambton,
Earl of Durham. All this gave
sure evidence of weakness on the
part of the Government, and encouraged
the discontented among
its old supporters to aim at its overthrow.
On the other hand, Sir
James Graham, as if looking rather
to a fusion than to the break-up of
parties, declared that he saw little
difference, except on the question
of the currency, between the opinions
entertained by the Opposition
on the one side, and the friends of
the Administration on the other.
And, as if to test the House, he
moved, on going into Committee of
Supply, that since Peel’s bill of
1819 was accepted as a final settlement
of the currency question, the
salaries of all public servants should
be cut down by 20 per cent. Though
listened to attentively, he received
small support, either from his own
friends or the friends of the Government;
but he added, by the vigour
of his appeal, to the reputation
which he had already acquired, and
was by common consent assigned
a place with Lord Althorpe, Lord
John Russell, and Mr Brougham,
as one of the leaders of the Opposition
in the House of Commons.</p>

<p class='c009'>Early in May 1830 the Parliamentary
campaign opened in earnest,
by a notice of motion by Sir
James Graham for a return of all
the pensions, salaries, and emoluments
then receivable by members
of the Privy Council. His speech
was, in its own way, a telling one;
and the motion was met by a proposal
from the Chancellor of the
Exchequer to supply the honourable
member with a comprehensive
enumeration of all civil and military
offices and salaries under the
Crown. Sir James either felt or
affected great indignation, and, in
rejecting Mr Goulbourne’s counter-proposal,
made use of the expression,
“That he was not disposed
to stoop to ignoble game
while flights of voracious birds of
prey were floating in the upper
regions of the air.” This was one
of the clap-traps in which Sir James
on all convenient occasions indulged,
and it had its effect. Not
fewer than 147 members in a
House of 382 voted with him—a
remarkable sign of the times, a
sure proof that men’s passions had
overclouded their reason on many
matters, and that Government by
party, as it had once existed, was
for a season at least at an end.</p>

<p class='c009'>Encouraged by the plaudits which
were heaped upon him, Sir James,
after remaining quiet for a few
weeks, moved to reduce the grant
for special diplomatic missions from
£28,000 to £18,000 a year. He was
again opposed with all the strength
which the Government could muster,
and again failed. But failure
on this occasion was accepted on
both sides as a triumph. In a
House of 217 members, the motion
was rejected by a majority of 19
only. It was a blow to the Ministers
scarcely less severe than that
which they received the same evening,
when Sir James Mackintosh
carried his clause in the Forgery
Bill against them—abolishing the
punishment of death in all cases
except where wills were concerned.</p>

<p class='c009'>The death of George IV., on the
20th of June 1830, was soon followed
by the dissolution of Parliament.
Sir James went back to his constituents
with a reputation largely enhanced;
and while his canvass was
at its height, tidings of the revolution
in Paris arrived. They set the
whole country in a blaze, and two
Liberal members immediately started
for Cumberland. A fierce contest
ensued, of the temper of which
some idea may be formed when we
transcribe one of the toasts which
was proposed and accepted amid a
tempest of applause at a public dinner
given to Sir James Graham at
Whitehaven—“May the heads of
Don Miguel, King Ferdinand, and
Charles Capet be severed from their
bodies and roll in the dust, and the
sooner the better.” It would be
unfair to the memory of Sir James
Graham if we omitted to add that
he wholly disapproved of this sentiment,
and that, while applauding
the revolution, he expressed himself
anxious that the French people
should use their victory with moderation.</p>

<p class='c009'>We have now arrived at an era
into the history of which it would
be out of place, while sketching
Sir James Graham’s career, to enter
much at length. The elections of
1830 had gone against the Government,
and the country seemed to
have become a prey to anarchy.
There were incendiary fires in many
places; and when Parliament met
in November to provide a remedy,
the worst spirit manifested itself in
both Houses. The King’s visit to
the Lord Mayor of London was
postponed; and the Duke, with extraordinary
rashness, gave utterance
to a statement which his enemies
insisted on accepting as a manifesto
against all reform. A coalition between
the Whigs and the ultra-Tories
to expel him from power
ensued, and Ministers, being defeated
on a question of the civil-list,
resigned their places. In
bringing all this to pass Sir James
had taken an active part, and he
received his reward in the appointment
of First Lord of the Admiralty,
with a seat in Earl Grey’s
Cabinet. He was placed at the Admiralty,
however, rather as representing
ultra opinions than from
any admiration of his talents and
industry; for Earl Grey, desiring
above all things to throw the authority
of Government into the
hands of aristocrats, was too prudent
to overlook the policy, situated
as he then was, of having
every great party in the State represented
in his Cabinet. Hence
the Duke of Richmond, Mr Wynn,
Lord Palmerston, Lord Goderich,
and Mr Charles Grant, were invited
to take their seats beside Lord
Lansdowne, Lord Althorpe, and
Lord Carlisle; and Lord Durham,
Sir James Graham, and Lord Melbourne
readily joined them. Among
all these there was not one who displayed
so large an amount of administrative
ability as Sir James
Graham, or who with so much frankness
acknowledged, when the proper
time came, that the improvements
effected by him in the department
were little more than the execution
of plans which his predecessor had
already arranged and determined
upon.</p>

<p class='c009'>Earl Grey had taken office pledged
to three things,—Retrenchment,
Non-intervention in Foreign Affairs,
and Parliamentary Reform. Into
all these Sir James Graham eagerly
threw himself. Returned again
without opposition for Cumberland,
he took up his residence at the Admiralty,
and worked like a slave to
keep ahead of the enormous amount
of business which devolved upon
him. For now his real worth was
discovered. What might be wanting
in brilliancy he endeavoured to make
up by labour; and he held his own,
not without a hard fight for it,
in the House of Commons. Lord
Althorpe, the acknowledged leader
of the Ministerial party, was slow
and confused. He derived the
greatest benefit from the subtle and
ambitious promptings of Graham,
and often sought for them. Whether
the proposal in the first Whig budget
to impose a tax on the transfer
of stock came from this source does
not appear; but the measure, in
spite of the eloquence with which
Sir James Graham supported it,
met with no success, and was withdrawn
amid the jeers of the House.</p>

<p class='c009'>This was a bad beginning, and
his speech in defence of the army
estimates proved equally unfortunate.
The pledge of non-intervention
had been thrown over by the
Government in the case of Belgium,
and an increase to the army was
asked for. In advocating this increase,
Sir James allowed himself
considerable latitude of speech in
regard to the condition of Ireland,
and O’Gorman Mahon, conceiving
that he, among others, had been
attacked, called upon the First
Lord to retract, or else to give him
personal satisfaction. Sir James
requested Lord Althorpe to act for
him on that occasion, and the
quarrel was amicably settled.</p>

<p class='c009'>The improvements introduced
into the constitution of the Admiralty
were chiefly these: Sir James
abolished the Victualling and Navy
Boards as separate establishments;
he required the accounts of the
office to be kept by double entry;
he proposed to throw open the great
national asylum at Greenwich to seamen
of the mercantile marine; and,
failing to accomplish that, he relieved
the mercantile marine from the
special tax which it had heretofore
borne. Nor was he all the while exempt
from a full share of the burden
of administration in other respects.
Earl Grey never lost sight of the
pledge which he had given to reform
the representative system
throughout the United Kingdom,
and a committee of four was appointed
to investigate the whole
subject, and to report upon it to the
Cabinet. Lord Durham, Lord John
Russell, Lord Duncannon, and Sir
James Graham composed that committee,
of which no member worked
more steadily and with greater zeal
than Sir James.</p>

<p class='c009'>It is not our purpose to tell over
again the thrice-told tale of the
bloodless revolution of 1831–32. In
preparing the scheme which the
Government was to bring forward,
Sir James Graham appears to have
been less extravagant than some of
his colleagues. He desired to interfere
as little as possible with
existing rights in counties, except
by adding copyholders and leaseholders
to the ancient freeholders.
In boroughs he was an advocate
for occupancy as a condition to
freedom, and was willing that the
limit of the pecuniary qualifications
should be wide. He objected to the
ballot, and to anything like an attempt
to establish perfect uniformity
of franchise anywhere. Yet such
was his infirmity of purpose that he
yielded his own opinions to those
of men of stronger will, and affixed
his signature to a report which recommended
the ballot and other
arrangements of which he disapproved.
It was this weakness, indeed—this
apparent inability to
arrive at settled convictions and
to stand by them—which constituted
the great flaw in Sir James
Graham’s character as a public man.
His biographer, we observe, commends
him for the specialty, and
endeavours to make what was mere
irresolution stand in the light of
judicial impartiality. “Half his
life,” says Mr Torrens, “was spent
in comparing and pondering opposite
results, and determining judicially
in the silence and solitude
of his study on which side the balance
lay. ‘Upon the whole’ again
and again occurs throughout his
private correspondence and public
judgments, for judgments they
frequently were—a phrase which a
statesman of a constitutional country
may well employ as eminently
expressive of the true candour and
humility of wisdom.” Doubtless
this is true; but if we find the
statesman afterwards going apart
from his own conclusions, and falling
in with proposals against which
he had “on the whole” decided,
what can we say of him except that
his humility degenerates into weakness,
and that, whatever qualities he
may possess, firmness of purpose is
certainly not one of them?</p>

<p class='c009'>It is a remarkable fact that not
even now could Sir James Graham
command the attention of the
House. His great attention to
business, his value on a committee,
and his administrative abilities, were
very generally acknowledged, but
as a speaker he made little or no
impression. Even his advocacy of
what may be called his own measure
was felt to be feeble—a strange
medley of confused discussion and
turgid enunciations. But the bill
had other sources of strength to
depend upon than the logic of its
Parliamentary supporters. Political
unions and conspiracies out of
doors did the work, and the King
and the House of Lords were forced
to accept their own humiliation.
First came the dissolution on the
23d of April 1831, a step into which
William IV. was coerced by the overbearing
insolence of Earl Grey and
Lord Chancellor Brougham. Then
followed elections wherein brute
force bore down all opposition,
and by-and-by such an assembly at
Westminster as struck terror into
the hearts of the Ministers who
had brought it together. On the
top of that wave Sir James Graham
was again borne into Parliament—a
colleague being given to him of
opinions far more advanced than
his own. So it befell in the borough
of Carlisle, so also in the neighbouring
county of Westmoreland.
It is quite certain that Sir James
Graham did not contemplate the
crisis, which he had helped to bring
on, without alarm. “We have ventured,”
he says, speaking of himself
and his colleagues, “to drive nearer
the brink than any other statesman
ever did before; but we did so because
aware that if we let go the
reins the horses would be maddened
into plunging headlong into the
abyss, where extrication would be
impossible.”</p>

<p class='c009'>We have alluded elsewhere to
Sir James Graham’s reconstruction
of the departments in the Admiralty.
It is creditable to him that
he disclaimed all the merit of originality
in such reconstruction. He
discovered, on acceding to office,
that plans of practical reform were
already settled, and he had the
good sense to accept and act upon
them as his own. He found a willing
adviser likewise in Lord Melville,
who kept back nothing from
him when consulted. Having completed
this job, he set himself next
to devise some means of getting rid
of the necessity of impressment,
and was again fortunate enough to
have brought to him an important
letter, addressed by Lord Nelson to
Earl St Vincent. The letter in
question suggested that there ought
to be a registration of seamen,
among whom, at the sudden outbreak
of war, a ballot should take
place, with permission, as in the
militia, to find substitutes. But,
anxious as he was to accomplish
this object, he shrank as a Minister
of the Crown from openly striking
a blow at the prerogative. When,
therefore, Mr Buckingham moved,
“That the forcible impressment
of seamen for His Majesty’s navy
was unjust, cruel, inefficient, and
unnecessary,” Sir James Graham
resisted the motion. He fought,
however, less for the evil itself
than for the manner of applying
a remedy, and obtained leave of
the House to bring in a bill which
has many admirable points in it,
but which he was not destined to
guide through its various stages
till it became law.</p>

<p class='c009'>The years 1833 and 1834 were
seasons of sore trial to the Reform
Government. They had evoked a
power at home which they found
themselves ill able to control. They
had entered into treaties and engagements
abroad, the necessity of
acting up to which involved them
in heavy expenses. But most of all
were they hampered and annoyed
by the operations of the Irish party,
which, after helping them to carry
their great measure, asked for its
reward. The Irish Established
Church must be sacrificed; and
the better to insure a speedy attainment
of that object, an agitation
was got up for the repeal of
the Union. Now, Earl Grey was
not a man to endure contradiction
calmly; he introduced a stern Coercion
Bill into the House of Lords,
which his colleagues fought inch
by inch in the House of Commons.
In order to conciliate their Radical
supporters, they proposed at the
same time to reduce the number of
Irish bishops, and to substitute for
church-rate in Ireland moneys to
be raised by taxes imposed on all
sees and benefices. Finally, after
providing, as was assumed, a better
method of managing episcopal and
chapter lands, a clause in their bill
declared “That it should be lawful
to appropriate any portion thence
accruing to purposes of secular utility,
without regard to the religious
opinions of persons to be benefited.”
This famous clause (the 147th) was
warmly debated, and in the end
withdrawn. But neither section of
the Legislature seemed to be satisfied.
Indeed, in the Cabinet itself
diversity of opinion was held in
regard to that matter, and no great
while elapsed ere diversity of opinion
led to separation.</p>

<p class='c009'>The first overt proof of schism in
the Cabinet was presented by the
opposite sides which Sir James
Graham and his colleagues took on
Mr O’Connell’s motion of censure
upon the Irish judge, Sir William
Smith. Sir James stoutly resisted
it. Mr Stanley, Lord Althorpe, and
Lord John Russell voted for it.
On a division, Sir James went out
with a minority of 74, and next
morning tendered his resignation.
He had proved himself, however,
too valuable a member of the Administration
to be cast adrift, and
Earl Grey refused to part with him.
Three nights afterwards he committed
another crime by acknowledging
in his place that the economy
effected by his predecessors
at the Admiralty was quite equal to
his own. Then followed a discussion
upon the Corn Laws, which
he defended as they stood; whereas
Mr Poulett Thompson, Vice-President
of the Board of Trade, proposed
to substitute a fixed duty for
a sliding-scale. And here an incident
befell which deserves notice.
Mr Poulett Thompson endeavoured
to confute his opponent by reading
extracts from a pamphlet which had
appeared in 1830, and in which the
author, under the <em>nom de guerre</em> of
a Cumberland Landowner, advocated
entire freedom of trade in
corn, as in other commodities.
Strange to say, Sir James Graham
took no notice of the ironical cheers
which followed these quotations, and
which marked the conviction of the
House that the pamphlet had emanated
from his pen. Yet such was
not the case. The pamphlet was
the work of a Mr Rooke, and was
acknowledged as such when, four
years subsequently, the author gave
to the world a volume on the science
of geology. Why Sir James Graham
did not decline the honour thrust
upon him at the moment, we are
at a loss to conceive, and his biographer
certainly assigns no satisfactory
reason for the proceeding.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Cabinet worked on not very
amicably, and Sir James Graham
did it what service he could by
taking charge of its bill for remodelling
the Exchequer Office. But
the time was come when he felt
that he could serve it no longer.
Lord Wellesley’s measure for converting
tithes in Ireland into a
permanent rent-charge on the land
was cumbered by a question from
Mr Shiel, drawing from Lord John
Russell something like a pledge,
that the Government might hereafter
consider the propriety of applying
a portion of this rent-charge
to secular purposes. And a few
days later Mr Ward brought forward
his motion, “That the Protestant
Episcopal Establishment in
Ireland exceeds the spiritual wants
of the Protestant population, and
that, it being the right of the State
to regulate the distribution of
Church property in such a manner
as Parliament might determine, it
is the opinion of this House ‘that
the temporal possessions of the
Church of Ireland, as established by
law, ought to be reduced.’” There
was no evading a movement like
this. The Cabinet must either resist
or accept Mr Ward’s motion,
and a majority determined to accept
it. Now, however Radical Sir
James Graham’s views might be
on other points, he was then, as
he always had been, a consistent
Churchman. On many previous
occasions he had declared his determination
to defend to the uttermost
the inviolability of what he
regarded as a fundamental institution
of the Empire; and the Duke
of Richmond, Lord Ripon, and Mr
Stanley agreed with him. When,
therefore, this Act for confiscating
the property of the Church was
accepted by the Cabinet as its own,
the four Ministers above named
felt that only one course lay open
to them: they retired from the
Administration, and shook it thereby
to its base.</p>

<p class='c009'>Sir James sat below the gangway,
on the Ministerial side of the
House, while those gyrations went
on which ended in shaking Earl
Grey out of the Premier’s chair,
and Lord Melbourne into it. With
Mr Stanley, and the half-dozen
friends who adhered to him, Sir
James kept aloof from each of the
rival parties, becoming one of the
company who, as Mr O’Connell described
it, “travelled by themselves
in the Derby Dilly.” It is not for
us to inquire into the motives
which animated the little band at
that time. But considerations of
delicacy towards old friends were
surely rated above their just value
when they induced Mr Stanley and
Sir James Graham, a few months
subsequently, to decline taking office
under Sir Robert Peel. Had they
met his advances as frankly as
they deserved, the Conservative
Government of 1835 would have
probably stood its ground; and
though it be difficult to conceive,
looking both at things present and
things past, how the commercial
system, now in the ascendant, could
have been pushed aside, still the
progress of that system would have
been probably more gradual; it
certainly might have achieved its
triumph at a sacrifice less costly
than the disruption of the great
Tory party, which followed on the
repeal of the Corn Laws in 1846.</p>

<p class='c009'>Sir James was coldly looked
upon by the Liberals for abandoning
Earl Grey’s Administration, and
a cabal was got up to resist his re-election
for East Cumberland in
the event of his taking office with
Sir Robert Peel. He refused to
take office, as we have shown, and
defended himself well at the hustings
against the attacks which
were made upon him. East Cumberland
chose him again to be its
representative, and he again took
his seat below the gangway on the
Ministerial side of the House. As
an independent member, however,
he stood aloof from the struggle
between Sir Robert Peel and the
Whigs, till Lord John Russell
brought forward his famous motion
“For the appropriation to
secular purposes of a portion of
the Church property in Ireland.”
Then Sir James Graham threw
over all party scruples. He delivered
against the motion one of
the most telling speeches which he
ever uttered in Parliament, and
went out into the gallery with that
gallant band which failed to keep
their chief in office by twenty-five
votes only. From that moment his
severance from the Whigs became
a mere question of time, and the
bitterness with which the Municipal
Reform Bill was argued hurried
it on. Sir James had never
desired to swamp the poorer voters,
either in counties or boroughs, and
voted against the extinction of the
class of freemen. Having gone
out with the Tories, he was preparing
to cross the House to his
old seat, when a storm of derisive
cheering greeted him, accompanied
by shouts of “Stay where you are!”
He stopped, looked angrily at the
benches whence the sounds proceeded,
and then sat down with a
smile of scorn on his lips on one of
the Opposition benches.</p>

<p class='c009'>For the part which he took in resisting
the extension to Ireland of
the municipal changes which were
effected in England and in Scotland,
Mr Torrens severely censures Sir
James Graham. This is natural
enough. Going far beyond his
hero in Radical propensities, Mr
Torrens dispenses blame where men
of moderate views would award
praise. He seems to forget that all
legislation for Ireland was undertaken
in those days with a twofold
purpose only—to conciliate Mr
O’Connell, and to humble the House
of Lords. The Melbourne Ministry,
however, rode their hobby too
fast. Not a few of the most distinguished
of the old reformers fell
off from them. Indeed, to such a
height was the spirit of alienation
carried, that not Sir James Graham
only, but likewise Lord Brougham,
Sir Francis Burdett, and Lord
Stanley, withdrew their names from
Brookes’s, into which Mr O’Connell
had been received as a member.</p>

<p class='c009'>From this date up to the death
of William IV. in 1837, party spirit
prevailed in Parliament and out of
it, with a bitterness which has no
parallel in modern times. The
Ministers, existing by the breath
of Mr O’Connell and the Radicals,
seemed indifferent to the consequences
of the measures which they
proposed. The great body of the Opposition,
carried away by personal
dislike to their opponents, fought
more than one battle which it would
have been wise to avoid, and compelled
their more judicious leaders
to fight with them. On the whole,
however, the Duke in the House
of Lords and Sir Robert Peel in the
Commons managed matters well;
and it is only just to Sir James
Graham to add, that they found in
him a hearty as well as a prudent
coadjutor.</p>

<p class='c009'>The accession of her present
Majesty led, of course, to a dissolution,
and Sir James Graham had
the mortification to find himself
opposed in East Cumberland by
Major Aglionby, formerly his fastest
friend. He received, on the
other hand, but a doubtful support
from the Conservatives, and on the
day of nomination the mob refused
to hear him. Naturally proud, and
perhaps a little dissatisfied with
himself, he quitted the hustings,
and went to the poll in bad heart.
He was defeated by a majority of
upwards of 500 votes, and withdrew,
full of indignation, to Netherby.
He had suffered not long before
this a heavy domestic affliction in the
death of his mother; and mortified
ambition, coming on the back of
private sorrow, wellnigh broke him
down. He took no further part in
county business; he shut himself
out from county society, and spent
his time chiefly in reading every
new book that came out, and corresponding
on important subjects with
Sir Robert Peel. It was the interval
between his defeat for East
Cumberland and his return to Parliament
as member for the Welsh
borough of Pembroke which made
him, what he ever after continued
to be, a Peelite to the backbone.</p>

<p class='c009'>In 1838 Sir James Graham was
elected Lord Rector of the University
of Glasgow, in opposition to
the Duke of Sussex. He delivered
an inaugural address, which is probably
still remembered in consequence
of the uproar which it called
forth by certain allusions to the
necessity of keeping the Church
in alliance with the State; for
then the fever of Free-Kirk folly
was at its height in Scotland. But
in 1839 he had graver matters to attend
to. That systematic agitation
against the Corn Laws having already
begun of which Mr Charles Villiers,
and not Mr Cobden, was the author.
Sir James spoke in his place against
interference with the sliding-scale;
at the same time he guarded himself
from the charge of desiring to
secure a monopoly in the corn-market
for the English landowner,
and went out of his way to warn
the House that nothing could be
more perilous to English interests
than that monopoly in the supply
of cotton which had been conceded
to America. He was anxious even
then that steps should be taken to
encourage the better cultivation of
the plant in India, and pressed
upon the President of the Board of
Control the wisdom of originating
such a scheme. Words of warning
which, disregarded at the moment,
come back upon us now with a
melancholy echo!</p>

<p class='c009'>The progress of the struggle,
which ended in the withdrawal of the
Appropriation Clause and the passing
of the Irish Municipal Reform
Bill through both Houses of Parliament,
is of too recent date to require
that we should speak of it in detail.
So is the contest which arose about
softening down some of the clauses
in the New Poor-Law, of which
Sir James, though advocating the
law itself, was a strenuous advocate.
His speech on that occasion,
as well as his censure of the job
which pensioned Sir John Newport
and raised Mr Spring Rice to the
peerage, more and more drew towards
him the sympathies of the
Conservative party, which indeed
had already begun to look to him
as one of its future leaders. He
was equally efficient in his attacks
on the Whig mismanagement of
affairs in India and in China, and
certainly did not spare his old
friends when stirred by their rebukes
into invective. At last the collapse
came, and in 1841 the country
declared against the Whigs. A new
Administration was formed, with
Sir Robert Peel at its head. Sir
James Graham accepted the seals of
the Home Office, and for five years
public affairs were carried on, if
not smoothly in all respects, with
remarkable success upon the whole.
No doubt, Lord Aberdeen’s legislation
in the matter of the Church
of Scotland proved unfortunate,
and there was little in Sir James
Graham’s manner to reconcile the
discontented portion of the Scottish
clergy to the law as it stood.
Indeed, it is a remarkable fact, that
almost all the failures in Sir Robert
Peel’s policy occurred on points
of which the management devolved
upon Sir James Graham. To him,
in a great degree, was attributed
the disruption in the Scottish
Church. His bill for the amendment
of the Factory Act of 1833
hung fire, and was withdrawn;
while his attempt to reform the
ecclesiastical courts in England utterly
broke down.</p>

<p class='c009'>In 1843 the difficulties of the
Administration really began. Ireland
was the rock ahead which
they found it impossible to weather.
They brought in one bill, which they
ultimately abandoned, and were
content to appoint a Commission,
with Lord Devon at its head, to
inquire into the state of the country
with a view to future legislation.
To some of their adherents, moreover,
they appeared to be shaken
in their adhesion to the sliding
scale of duties on the importation
of foreign corn; and day by day
the great fact became more obvious
that Parliamentary government,
based on a widely-extended suffrage,
is scarcely compatible with
the continuance of monarchy. Fortunately,
perhaps, for them, Mr
O’Connell chose this moment to reawaken
the demand in Ireland for
the dissolution of the Union, and
to inflame the passions of the people
by his monster meetings. Great,
we should now say unnecessary,
forbearance was exhibited in dealing
with this movement; but at
last a manifesto appeared, which,
besides calling upon the masses to
assemble at Clontarf, invited the
“Repeal cavalry” to attend in
troops of twenty-five,—each under
its own officers. The Lord-Lieutenant
and Lord Chancellor of Ireland
happened both to be in London
at the time. They met Sir
James Graham at the Home Office
with the law officers of the Crown,
and that decisive step was taken
which not only dispersed the meeting
of Clontarf, but shut up Mr
O’Connell in jail.</p>

<p class='c009'>We believe that Sir James Graham
did nothing more than his
duty to the Crown and to the
country throughout these proceedings.
He contrived, however, to
concentrate all the bile of the Opposition
on his own head, and a
manner, not always very gracious,
repelled, if it did not positively disgust,
not a few of the supporters
of the Administration. It so happened
also, that his bill for limiting
the hours of labour in the
factories did not meet the views
either of the mill-owners or of Lord
Ashley (the present Lord Shaftesbury)
and his friends. The result
was, that being defeated on one
point by Lord Ashley, and on another
by the mill-owners, he withdrew
his measure, and sustained,
as unsuccessful legislators usually
do, some loss of character from the
process. But the most damaging
event in the course of his Administration
was his having authorised,
by warrant, the letters of Mazzini
and other refugees to be opened
at the General Post-Office. A dead
set was made at him; and though
he showed clearly enough that the
law bore him out, he escaped by a
majority of only forty-two in a full
House—a narrow one, considering
the state of parties—the mortification
of having his conduct inquired
into by a committee of the House
of Commons. It is not for us to
say why Lord Aberdeen maintained
a profound silence in the House of
Lords when the subject came to be
discussed there. His Lordship was
never famous for excess of pluck;
and it was generally believed at
the time, and is indeed highly probable,
that Lord Aberdeen, being
Minister for Foreign Affairs, had
at least as much to do with the
transaction as the Home Secretary.
The truth, however, is, that a great
deal too much was made of the
matter. Lord John Russell and Mr
Macaulay, with other leaders of the
Opposition, supported Tom Duncombe
in his demand; while Sir
Robert Peel resisted it, though with
his usual caution. At last, on the
suggestion of Sir James himself, a
committee was named to inquire
privately, when it came out that
there had not been a Secretary of
State for the last hundred years
but had signed warrants similar to
that issued by Sir James, and that,
in doing as he had done, he acted
upon precedent, with, as it happened,
more than common moderation.</p>

<p class='c009'>We come now to the Peel policy
of 1845, the renewal of the income-tax
and the “further lightening of
the springs of industry,” by striking
out 430 out of 813 articles on
which customs duties still continued
to be levied. It would be satisfactory
to know what share Sir James
Graham had in the inauguration
and adoption of that policy. Suspicion
was rife at the moment, and
it still remains, that he took a very
active part in pressing its adoption
on the Cabinet. But Mr Torrens
throws no light whatever upon the
subject. He reminds us, indeed,
of some witty sayings uttered on
the occasion, such as “that the
old leaven of Holland House would
work till it produced a thorough
fermentation,” &#38;c., and chronicles
the beginnings of Mr Disraeli’s influence,
by quoting his cutting remarks,
“that Protection in 1845
was in the same position with Protestant
ascendancy in 1828;” and
that “a Conservative Government
was an organised hypocrisy.” But
not a line is given of private correspondence
to show what Sir James’s
opinions really were with reference
to the present or the past. So it is
when Mr Torrens comes to describe
the course of legislation which led
to the permanent endowment of
Maynooth, and the setting up of
what Sir Robert Inglis called
“Godless Colleges” in Ireland. We
have a not uninteresting digest of
each debate as it occurred, the
names of the speakers on both
sides being duly recorded; but of
Sir James Graham is said no
more than of Mr George Bankes
or of Mr Ward, or of others even
less worthy of notice than the latter
gentlemen. This is the more
to be regretted that Mr Torrens
speaks feelingly of the enormous
amount of labour which the subject
of his biography underwent, and
which, we may venture to add,
from our own personal knowledge
of the man, the biographer has by
no means overrated. The fact is,
that Sir James Graham was what
has been termed a glutton of work.
Such was the constitution of his
mind, that before deciding upon
any point, whether practical or theoretical,
he looked round and round
for argument on both sides, and not
unfrequently continued to doubt
after he had arrived at a judgment.
One thing, however, is certain: he
had already, in 1845, become a
convert to the doctrines of free
trade, and was very urgent in his
recommendations to the chief of
the Cabinet to inaugurate an entire
change of system. Now, Sir Robert
Peel, as his famous Elbing letter
showed, scarcely stood in need of
such pressure. Thrown by mere
accident into the Tory party, he
never made common cause with it,
and seemed to rejoice that the time
was at length come for humbling
the aristocrats who had so long
made use of his talents while affecting
socially to look down upon
him.</p>

<p class='c009'>We need not stop to repeat the
thrice-told tale of the anti-corn-law
agitation, or of the potato blight in
the autumn of 1846, and its consequences.
Enough is done when
we state, that from the first appearance
of that disease Sir James
Graham saw but one remedy for
the evil. In the discussions which
ensued he ranged himself with
Lord Aberdeen and Mr Sidney
Herbert on the side of the Premier,
and never, as he subsequently declared,
gave a vote with greater
satisfaction in his life than that
which broke up the Peel Government,
and dislocated the great
party which it had taken years to
consolidate. Not very popular at
any time either with the Whigs or
their rivals; disliked by the former
for his desertion on the Irish Church
question; distrusted by the latter
because of the political creed of his
youth,—he now drew down upon
his own head an amount of obloquy,
more enduring, if not, for the moment,
more intense, than that
with which the recreant Tory chief
was overwhelmed; and the time
shortly arrived when, partly on this
account, partly because his proud
heart rebelled against the dictates
of his contemporaries, public life,
especially official, if not Parliamentary
life, became to him intolerable.</p>

<p class='c009'>We must hurry over what remains
to be told of this versatile
yet vigorous statesman. When Lord
Aberdeen formed his Coalition Cabinet,
Sir James Graham returned to
the Admiralty, where the Crimean
war took him by surprise, as it did
all the other members of the Administration.
Sir James, however,
put a bold face upon the matter,
and having selected Sir Charles
Napier to command the worst-found
and worst-manned fleet
that ever quitted the English
shores, he sent him, at the worst
season of the year, to try what
could be done for the destruction
of Russian power in the Baltic.
It was unfortunate, both for the
First Lord and for the Admiral,
that the Reform Club chose to give
the latter a dinner. The speeches
uttered on that occasion, and especially
Sir James Graham’s speech,
resembled more the pæans of victors
after the strife, than the statements
of men about to incur the hazard
of a campaign; and the abortive
issue of the expedition covered
both with ridicule. It did more,
however, than this. A bitter quarrel
ensued, which was prosecuted not
very decorously, sometimes in the
House of Commons, sometimes
through the press, and which had
no other result than to damage
both parties very seriously in the
estimation of the public.</p>

<p class='c009'>The break-up of the Aberdeen
Cabinet—to which, by the by, Sir
James greatly contributed—may be
said to have brought his public life
to a close. He retained, indeed, his
seat in Parliament—Carlisle having
returned him as a good Radical
member on two separate occasions.
And though he seldom spoke, it
was always in angry opposition to
the Conservative party, once more
reunited under Lord Derby and
Mr Disraeli. Private sorrows, however,
began to tame him down. In
1857 Lady Graham died—a terrible
blow, from which he never recovered;
and the death of Lord
Herbert in August 1861 affected
him deeply. To that excellent
man, and at heart most Conservative
politician, Sir James Graham
was much attached. It seemed, indeed,
as if to him had been transferred
the entire stock of love and
respect of which Sir Robert Peel,
while living, had engrossed the
larger share; and now, when the
grave closed over Lord Herbert, life
appeared to have no more interest
for Sir James Graham. He made
a long journey, in very inclement
weather, to attend the funeral of
his friend at Wilton, and, returning
immediately afterwards to the
north, scarcely smiled again. Our
latest recollection of him is in
church—a tall, handsome, yet shattered
man, earnest in his devotions,
but bearing upon his brow the
cloud which was never to be raised
on this side the grave. He died
at Netherby, surrounded by his
children, on the 25th of October
1861.</p>

<p class='c009'>It has been said of Sir James
Graham that he narrowly escaped
being a great man. Certainly he
possessed some of the qualities
which contribute to build up greatness.
He was patient, for example,
of labour; careful in coming to conclusions;
not at all over-scrupulous
in changing or retaining opinions;
and a first-rate administrator. But
there was not a touch of genius
about him, nor one shade of originality.
His moral timidity was
greater than the world supposed it
to be. He often shrank from taking
a step which his deliberate
judgment approved; he often did
what he had resolved not to do, and
repented afterwards. Such a man
was not fit to lead; and the inward
consciousness of his own weakness,
perhaps, hindered him from ever
aspiring to become the head of an
administration. His usefulness, on
the other hand, as the second or
confidential supporter of a great
minister, cannot be over-estimated.
He had much improved in later
years as a speaker, and commanded
the attention of the House; but
the style of his oratory continued
to the last in perfect accord with
his intellectual organisation. On
ordinary occasions it was stiff, perhaps
pedantic; when anything occurred
to ruffle or excite, it became
sharp and personal—more, perhaps,
than the speaker intended it to be.
Taking all this into account, we
arrive at the conclusion, that the
position which he achieved among
the statesmen of the passing age
was exactly that which nature intended
him to fill. He stood neither
in the front rank nor perhaps in the
second, but took a very prominent
place in the third. In private life
he was highly estimable, possessing,
however, few of those qualities
which gather round their owner
troops of devoted friends. His
manners were reserved, except with
those who knew him intimately;
his nature was proud, but he was
kind-hearted, charitable, and deeply
religious—being free from the two
extremes of silly mannerism on the
one hand, and pharisaical austerity
on the other. He was buried in
the churchyard of his own village,
only the members of his family and
a few old friends following him to
the grave.</p>

<p class='c009'>If, at some future day, perhaps
still remote, when the present
wearer of the triple tiara shall have
descended into the tomb, and when
the power of some who now support
him shall be numbered with
the things that were, Rome, in
compliance with the wishes of Italy,
shall become the capital of that
fairest of European kingdoms, there
will be one class of persons who,
although they may not regret it,
will be losers by the change, and
those are the foreigners, especially
English, who, for six months of the
year, take possession of all that is
best in the papal metropolis. In
addition to its garrison of French
troops, that renowned city has now
for many years submitted—with
a far better will than it does to
the presence of Gallic legions—to
a foreign occupation of a more
agreeable and profitable description.
Combining more varied attractions
than any other city in the
world, Rome has become the first
watering-place in Europe. Its
waters of Trevi are as fascinating
to votaries of pleasure and lovers
of art as the most salutary springs
to seekers after health. Its galleries
and antiquities offer years of
occupation, even to the most sedulous
of visitors, before these can say
that they have sufficiently seen and
studied them; its winter gaieties
and amusements are abundant to
satisfy the greediest of such enjoyments;
during its long spring (and
much of what is winter elsewhere
is spring at Rome) lovers of pleasant
rides and delightful scenery discover
that in such does the Campagna
abound. But still, to that majority
of its foreign visitors which soon
become sated with pictures and statues
and classical remains, Rome’s
chief attraction is unquestionably
the pomps and ceremonies, the
splendour and the shrines of that
Church whose headquarters the
Italians so earnestly desire to see
transported beyond the limits of
Italy. Remove the Pope, and of
course there is an end to the grand
solemnities in which he is the most
prominent figure; to the magnificent
<i><span lang="it">funzioni</span></i> of Holy Week, to
witness which thousands annually
flock to Rome, filling to the roof
every hotel and lodging-house; to
gorgeous ceremonials, brilliant processions,
and high festivals; to the
chairing of the Pontiff and the
feeding of the beggars; the washing
of feet and the sounding of silver
trumpets and the benediction from
the balcony, with its magnificent
scenic effect, with the golden chair
and the peacock fans, and the rest of
the sumptuous and dazzling paraphernalia.
All this must of course
depart whenever the Italian Government
takes its seat at Rome,
unless there should then be found
some member of the college of cardinals
willing to accept the Pontiff’s
spiritual heritage without his temporal
sway, and to retain his chair at
the Vatican whilst a King of Italy
thrones it at the Quirinal. The installation
of a commonplace lay
government could hardly fail to
diminish Rome’s present attractions
for foreigners. Everything is
now done to render it pleasant to
them in all ways. The utmost
consideration and regard for their
comfort and convenience are
shown by the government whose
capital they enrich, and by the
people, who look upon them as their
principal source of profit. Rome
has little industry or commerce to
live by; what prosperity she still enjoys
is due solely to the <i><span lang="it">forestieri</span></i>;
and, as these are chiefly heretics, the
anomaly ensues that the heretic is
made much more of in the city of the
Pope than in any other capital. For
him the best places everywhere—the
utmost possible immunity from
police annoyances—the blandest
smiles of doorkeepers and guardians
of galleries—the convenient place of
public worship, still denied to him
in that bigoted Spain which out-herods
Herod, and is more papist
than the Pope; and, to crown all
these advantages, should death
overtake him whilst sojourning in
Rome, he has the satisfaction of
being buried amongst hundreds of
his countrymen, some of them of no
mean repute, in one of the prettiest
flower-grown English cemeteries
that can anywhere be found. The
favour shown to him is a standing
joke in Rome. “I am off to the
Sistine, to hear the music,” says
Marforio to Pasquin. “Spare yourself
the trouble,” is the reply; “the
Swiss and the noble guards will not
let you in.” “Never fear,” answers
Marforio; “I have turned
heretic.” There is truth in the jest.
To heretics, Rome is indeed the
most tolerant of cities, as the Romans
are the most supple and complaisant
of hosts.</p>

<p class='c009'>It seems incredible that, in the
second half of the nineteenth century,
it should be found possible to
write two copious volumes about
Rome, in which most persons, even
of those who fancied they knew the
place thoroughly, might find not
only much to interest and amuse
them, but also a great many novel
facts and much original appreciation
of things and topics which they
thought had long since been worn
threadbare. A book, too, neither
critical nor political; neither playing
the cicerone through Roman
galleries, nor meddling, otherwise
than by such passing allusions as
sufficiently show the author’s sympathies
with the much-discussed
Roman question. Since there still
remained so much to be written on
so attractive a theme, how can we
explain its not having been done
years ago, by some of the many
English of literary tastes who annually
abide in Rome? The answer
is soon found. The English
in Rome—or, it may truly be said,
in Italy generally—do not, except
in very rare cases, get below the
superficial crust which veils from
them the richness of the mine beneath.
They work in a beaten
track, and he who arrives to-day
does neither more nor less than
he who yesterday departed. They
may conscientiously visit every object
mentioned in their guide-book—they
may reiterate those visits
until they can tell you from memory
the place of every picture
or statue in the Vatican or elsewhere,
and until they can fairly
say that they have thoroughly
“done” Rome in the vulgar acceptation
of the word. Still they have
explored, and seen, and heard but
a portion of what lies at their disposal,
and would well repay research;
they have scrutinised the
Rome of the past, but are ignorant
of the Rome of the present; they
have pondered over the graves of
the dead, but of the living they
know little or nothing. To a real
knowledge and enjoyment of Rome,
two things are essential—familiarity
with the language and intercourse
with the people—the former
being, of course, indispensable to the
latter. Comparatively few of the
thousands of English who annually
pass several months in the shadow
of St Peter’s—many of them returning
year after year to that
which is undeniably the most seductive
of Continental residences—obtain
familiar admission to the
highest circle of Roman society;
and still fewer care to seek an entrance
into any other, or to trouble
themselves to converse with natives
of lower degree. They treat Rome
as they would an extremely agreeable
watering-place in England;—they
go there to see the lions, to
enjoy a delightful climate and pleasant
environs, and to give each
other dinners and balls. They form
an English colony, according to the
usage of our countrymen; and their
circles are often as exclusive in
their way as that of the Roman
princes, to which only the highest
connections or most potent recommendations
insure access. Very
few, indeed, are the Italians who
find admission into the many pleasant
English houses each winter
sees opened in Rome. The English
live amongst themselves; they have
their own quarter (the best, as
usual, in the city), their own club,
hotels, shops, and habits; the men
scarcely ever enter an Italian <i><span lang="it">osteria</span></i>
or <i><span lang="it">café</span></i>, where they might glean
some notion of the manners and
customs of the natives, but they
appropriate two or three establishments
of the kind, which they
Anglicise to the utmost extent possible
in those latitudes, and which
the Romans soon learn to shun,
scared by the foreign invasion and
by the fancy prices charged for
base imitations of British viands.
Not one in a hundred of the English
who visit Rome are there after
May or before November; they see
the place and people only in their
winter and spring aspects; summer
and autumn are unknown to
them. Many complete their five
or six months’ term of residence
without acquiring even a smattering
of Italian; and when they
leave, all they know of the people
is what they may have learned
from lying <em>ciceroni</em>, or from native
servants and shopkeepers
possessed of sufficient English to
gull the <em>forestieri</em>. Now, let us
suppose a contrary case—that of an
Englishman (or American) of more
than average intelligence and cultivation,
with a keen appreciation of
art, a quick perception of the characteristic,
and a warm love for Rome,
who should abide for six years in
that city and its environs, not invariably
flying north from summer
heats, but contenting himself with
temporary retreats to one of the
charming nooks the neighbouring
hills afford, and who, thoroughly
familiar with the language, should
lose no opportunity of mingling
and conversing with the people,
chatting with all he met—with the
peasant in the field, the mendicant
by the road-side, the itinerant musician
who played beneath his window,
as well as with the physician,
the lawyer, the trader, and the
artist, with whom he might more
frequently and naturally be brought
in contact. Such a man, we apprehend,
would be well qualified to
write a fresh and pleasant and instructive
book concerning a city
whose fame must live for ever, and
which may appropriately be surnamed
the Inexhaustible as well
as the Eternal.</p>

<p class='c009'>Nobody who visited the great
Exhibition of 1862 will have failed
to observe and admire two pieces
of sculpture which the most competent
critics declared to be second
to none, even if they were equalled
by any of those there collected together.
The author of ‘Roba di
Roma,’ the foreign and fantastical
name of a very English and sensible
book, might have placed upon
its title-page, had it so pleased him,
“by the author of ‘Cleopatra’ and
the ‘Lybyan Sybil,’” and the advertisement
would have been no
bad one; for everybody who had
admired the sculptor’s beautiful
statues would have been curious to
see if he were as clever with the pen
as he was cunning with the chisel.
Mr Story, however, was above
seeking any such side-wind of
popularity, and proposed allowing
his literary labours to stand upon
their own merits. This they are
well able to do. As pleasant reading,
his book at once takes its
place in the foremost rank of its
class, whilst the information it contains
gives it a more solid and permanent
value than can be attained
by a work intended for mere amusement.
Without being in any degree
a guide-book, it contains a vast
deal which every visitor to Rome
would be glad to find in one.
There exists a series of Red Books,
much more generally studied than
the Blue ones, and with which
every Englishman is familiar who
pushes his Continental explorations
beyond Paris. Unequal in degree
of merit, the Briton abroad yet can
ill do without the worst of them.
Amongst the best must be reckoned
that for Rome—a work performed
conscientiously and <i><span lang="it">con amore</span></i> by a
genial and accomplished citizen of
the world, to whom the Eternal
City has become almost a second
<i><span lang="it">patria</span></i>. But the very best of handbooks
cannot exhaust its subject,
when that subject is Rome; and so
we counsel every visitor to the
papal capital to associate with his
Murray Mr Story’s ‘Roba.’</p>

<p class='c010'>“Every Englishman,” says this gentleman,
“carries a Murray for information
and a Byron for sentiment, and finds out
by them what he is to know and feel at
every step. Pictures and statues have
been staled by copy and description, until
everything is stereotyped, from the
Dying Gladiator, with his ‘young barbarians
all at play,’ down to the Beatrice
Cenci, the Madame Touson of the shops,
that haunts one everywhere with her
white turban and red eyes. Every ruin
has had its score of <em>immortelles</em> hung
upon it. The soil has been almost overworked
by antiquarians and scholars, to
whom the modern flower was nothing,
but the antique brick a prize. Poets
and sentimentalists have described to
death what the antiquaries have left,
and some have done their work so well
that nothing remains to be done after
them. All the public and private life
of the ancient Romans, from Romulus
to Constantine, is perfectly well known.
But the common life of the modern
Romans—the games, customs, and
habits of the people—the everyday of
to-day—has been only touched upon here
and there,—sometimes with spirit and
accuracy, as by Charles M‘Farlane;
sometimes with grace, as by Hans Christian
Andersen; and sometimes with
great ignorance, as by Jones, Brown,
and Robinson, who see through the eyes
of their courier and the spectacles of
their prejudices. There may be, among
the thousands of travellers that annually
winter at Rome, some to whom the common
out-door pictures of modern Roman
life would have a charm as special as the
galleries and antiquities, and to whom a
sketch of many things, which wise and
serious travellers have passed by as unworthy
their notice, might be interesting.”</p>

<p class='c008'>This last reflection suggested itself
to Mr Story as he drove into
Rome, somewhat more than six
years ago, on his third visit to that
capital, which has been his residence
ever since; and, as he is evidently
a man who likes to carry out
a good idea, he at once commenced
to hoard his observations for future
use and public benefit. The impression
made upon us by his two
copious volumes is, that they have
been composed <i><span lang="it">con amore</span></i>, and at perfect
leisure—conditions eminently
conducive to success in authorship.
That Mr Story loves Rome he need
not tell us; his attachment is manifest
in his pages. Who, indeed,
that has dwelt there long enough
to fall under its fascination, does
not love it and desire to return
thither? Everybody would fain
visit Rome, but those only who
have been there can fully appreciate
the charm it exercises. There are
places whose attractions imagination
is apt to overcolour, and which
consequently disappoint on near
acquaintance; but if there be persons
who thus find Rome fall short
of their expectations, they usually
are wise enough to keep it to themselves,
and so avoid the charge of extravagance.
Doubtless those whose
mind, education, and previous pursuits
and studies enable them fully
to appreciate and enjoy the treasures
of art, and of classical and historical
associations there heaped up, are
few compared to the visitors who
form but an imperfect and superficial
estimate of what they behold, and
who soon are glad to fall back upon
less intellectual pleasures. Of these
there is no lack. Agreeable society,
pleasant promenades, carnival diversions—theatres
which, if not uniformly
good, at least are sufficiently
attractive to audiences which go as
much to talk as to listen—the
vicinity of a picturesque country,
tempting to excursions, which may
be compressed into a day or extended
to weeks, according as one
keeps within the present limits of
the Papal territory, or stretches out
into Umbria, to Terni and Narni,
Perugia and Spoleto,—these varied
resources and advantages combine
to make Rome delightful, at least
in winter and spring, to almost
every class of visitors. Considering
how many who have visited it have
also written about it, it seems
scarcely possible, at this time, for
anybody to fill seven hundred close
pages with matter relating to it
without becoming prolix. That,
however, is a reproach no one can
address to Mr Story. His work
shows extensive reading, happily
made use of, close observation, and
the eye of a true artist. It admits
of a broad division into two parts—one
of these comprising solely what
he himself has seen, heard, and
thought; the other including much
for which he is indebted to many
books, studied to good purpose.
As a specimen of the last-named
portion, we may cite the chapter
entitled “The Colosseum”—the romantic
chronicle of that marvellous
structure. Its opening is a good
specimen of the author’s vivid,
rapid manner of placing before us
pictures painted in words:—</p>

<p class='c010'>“Of all the ruins in Rome, none is at
once so beautiful, so imposing, and so
characteristic as the Colosseum.<a id='r4'></a><a href='#f4' class='c007'><sup>[4]</sup></a> Here
throbbed the Roman heart in its fullest
pulses. Over its benches swarmed the
mighty population of the centre city of
the world. In its arena, gazed at by a
hundred thousand eager eyes, the gladiator
fell, while the vast <i><span lang="la">velarium</span></i>
trembled as the air was shaken by savage
shouts of ‘<i><span lang="la">Habet</span></i>,’ and myriads of cruel
hands, with upturned thumbs, sealed his
unhappy fate. The sand of the arena
drank the blood of African elephants,
lions, and tigers—of <em>Mirmilli</em>, <em>Laqueatores</em>,
<em>Retiarii</em>, and <em>Andabatæ</em>—and of
Christian martyrs and virgins. Here
emperor, senators, knights, and soldiers,
the lowest populace and the proudest
citizens, gazed together on the bloody
games, shouted together as the favourite
won, groaned together fiercely as he fell,
and startled the eagles sailing over the
blue vault above with their wild cries of
triumph. Here might be heard the
trumpeting of the enraged elephant, the
savage roar of the tiger, the peevish
shriek of the grave-rifling hyena; while
the human beasts above, looking on the
slaughter of the lower beasts beneath,
uttered a wilder and more awful yell.
Rome—brutal, powerful, bloodthirsty,
imperial Rome—built in its days of pride
this mighty amphitheatre, and, outlasting
all its works, it still stands, the best
type of its grandeur and brutality. What
St Peter’s is to the Rome of to-day, is
the Colosseum to the Rome of the Cæsars.
The baths of Caracalla, grand though
they be, sink into insignificance beside
it. The Cæsars’ palaces are almost level
with the earth. Over the pavement
where once swept the imperial robes
now slips the gleaming lizard; and in the
indiscriminate ruins of those splendid
halls the <em>contadino</em> plants his potatoes,
and sells for a <em>paul</em> the oxidised coin
which once may have paid the entrance
fee to the great amphitheatre. The
golden house of Nero is gone. The very
Forum where Cicero delivered his immortal
orations is all but obliterated,
and antiquarians quarrel over the few
columns that remain. But the Colosseum
still stands; despite the assault of
time and the work of barbarians it still
stands, noble and beautiful in its decay—yes,
more beautiful than ever.”</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f4'>
<p class='c008'><a href='#r4'>4</a>. We preserve Mr Story’s orthography, which, although unusual, is doubtless
correct. “The name Colosseum, or Coliseum as it is improperly called, seems to
have been derived from its colossal proportions, and not, as has been supposed by
some writers, from a colossal statue of one of the emperors placed within it”
(‘Roba,’ i. 222). A correspondent of the ‘Athenæum’ (7th February 1863) says that,
“in volume II. of the ‘Lives of the Roman Empresses,’ p. 50 (Edit. Naples, 1768),
there is a note which gives the reason why the correct orthography is Colosseum.
Referring to the completion of the great amphitheatre by Titus, the note has the
following: ‘Nel mezzo del Anfiteatro si sorgeva una grande statua rappresentante
Nerone, chiamata il Colosso di Nerone, da cui quel luogo prese il nome di Colosseo.’”
Mr Story remarks that the present name is comparatively modern, and first occurs
in the writings of the venerable Bede. To the ancient Romans the Colosseum was
known as the Amphiteatrum Flavium.</p>
</div>

<p class='c009'>How profound a calm has now
replaced the rush and roar of
conflict! You walk down to
the Colosseum on one of those
soft sunny mornings common in
Rome in the early months of the
year, and you find it kept by two
or three French sentries, and untenanted
save by as many dilapidated
<em>ciceroni</em>, who crawl out of
their secret recesses as you enter
the arena, and vie with each other
for the honour of conducting you
over the mighty remains, in which,
as Mr Story happily expresses it,
“Nature has healed over the wounds
of time with delicate grasses and
weeds.” The last time we visited
the Colosseum, the drummers of a
French regiment were out for practice
in its immediate vicinity, startling
the echoes of the wondrous old
edifice with a diabolical clatter of
stick against sheepskin. Saw-sharpening,
or the simultaneous tuning
of one hundred and fifty fiddles, is
hardly more vexatious to the nerves
than the discordant rub-a-dub of a
dozen squads of apprentice drummers,
pounding their instruments
with a deafening disregard to harmony.
Persons are differently affected
by the Colosseum, Mr Story
assures us—some with horror, some
with sentiment, some with statistics.
Persons who go there on
drum-practice days are doubtless
affected with a vehement desire to
get out of earshot. Apart from the
unpleasant nature of the noise, it,
and the sight of its originators, are destructive
of the day-dreams to which
solitude and quiet in that great dilapidated
structure are so eminently
favourable. Most persons will admit
that nothing in Rome has impressed
them so strongly as the Colosseum.
A German writer has
said that the Americans are particularly
affected by it, more so than
most Europeans; and if this be the
case, it is doubtless attributable to
the striking contrast the tourist
from beyond the Atlantic finds
between those ruins of a mighty
past and the upstart edifices of
his own bran-new country. The
Americans, it is said, were the
first to light up the Colosseum with
Bengal fires. A number of Germans,
artists and others, attempted
it with torches on a dark winter
night, but the means were insufficient:
the torches, although numerous,
struggled in vain to dispel the
deep nocturnal gloom which seemed
condensed in the giant ruin. The
attempt, however, gave the idea to
the Americans, who quickly found
the money for something on a
grander scale; and the Roman pyrotechnists,
who are first-rate in skill
and experience, produced an illumination
with coloured fires which
drew out to the Colosseum not only
the <em>forestieri</em> but the Romans themselves,
usually very careless of the
sights the foreigners most run after.
Since then such illuminations have
become comparatively common, and
have been witnessed by most persons
who have remained any time
in Rome. The effect is very striking,
and should be seen once, just
as one goes to see the statuary at
the Vatican by torchlight; but, for
both, the preference will generally
be given to daylight, and also, as
regards the Colosseum, to moonlight.
For the best description of
its appearance when lighted in this
last-named manner, Mr Story refers
us to a book entitled, ‘Rome and
its Rulers,’ by that impartial Irish
M.P., Mr John Francis Maguire,
who, when in the Pope’s dominions,
was so peculiarly fortunate as to
find there nothing which was not
in the highest degree admirable and
praiseworthy. Truly a book “in
which many things are scented
with rose-water,” as Mr Story remarks,
and which may also justly
be said to abound in moonshine.
Of this latter commodity, as collected
in the Colosseum, the eloquent
Maguire thus discourses:—</p>

<p class='c010'>“The moon was slowly pursuing her
way up the blue sky, and gradually rising,
<em>foot by foot</em>, to the height of the unbroken
wall of the building, <em>now and
then</em> peeping in through arch or window....
Patiently we awaited the
higher elevation and full splendour of
the chaste Dian, enjoying each new
effect as she sported with the venerable
ruin, and imparted to its grim antiquity
a youthful flush—mocking but delightful
illusion.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Nothing can be more striking
than this picture of the moon going
up-stairs at a steady, composed
pace, fearful, probably, of losing
breath by speed, and occasionally
pausing at a hole in the wall to
squint through it at her Hibernian
admirer. But your thoroughpaced
Irish or British Ultramontane is
very liable to lunar influences when
he gets to Rome; and if he chance
to be in Parliament, or in a position
to make his voice heard in his
own country, he is apt to have his
head completely turned by the interested
attentions shown to him in
the highest quarters. We have happened
more than once to see gentlemen
of that class, devoted supporters
of the Pope, by the influence of
whose Irish adherents they had
been carried into Parliament, arrive
in Rome during the recess to seek
materials for their speeches in the
approaching session. They stay
but a short time, and generally
know no Italian and little French,
but that is a very trifling drawback.
They find countrymen amongst
the immediate friends and daily
visitors of his Holiness, are made
much of at the Vatican, are crammed
to their hearts’ content with
carefully-prepared statistics and
fabulous facts, and depart convinced,
or seeming to be so, that
they have a thorough knowledge of
the state of the country, and that
all that has been said about Papal
misrule is sheer malignant invention.
They are taken to see the
prisons, and find them far better
and more humane in their arrangements
than those they looked into
as they passed through Piedmont.
Of course they do. In Piedmont
there is little attempt at concealment.
Whatever its faults, the Government
there does not take much
pains to appear better than it is.
In Rome the confiding M.P. sees
the model prisons—those kept for
inspection. Does he imagine he
has seen those where political prisoners
are confined? Surely Messrs
Maguire, Hennessey, Bowyer, and
Co., are not so credulous as that.
The Vatican is far too knowing not
to ease the consciences of its advocates.
Why should they be reduced
to the cruel alternative of silence or
of speaking in opposition to what
they know to be fact? In the Roman
prisons there are rooms set
apart for favoured prisoners, who
there enjoy light and air, and are
well fed and treated. Mr Maguire
was delighted with the Prison of
San Michele, where, “instead of
gloom, horror, and noisome dungeons,
I beheld a large, well-lighted,
well-ventilated, and (could such a
term be properly applied to any
place of confinement) cheerful-looking
hall.” He goes on to talk
of “the bright sun streaming in;
the superior size and arrangement
of the cells,” &#38;c. &#38;c. Mr Story,
who dwells a good deal on the subject
of Roman and Neapolitan prisons
(as the latter were under the
Bourbons), and supplies various
documents justificatory of the view
which he and every unbiassed and
rightly-informed person cannot do
otherwise than take of them, refers
to the well-known Casanova case—that
of an unfortunate young Italian
who, on his return from a residence
in America, was arrested at Viterbo
on the sole ground that he had
no passport, and subjected to the
most barbarous treatment in the
Carcere Nuovo at Rome. Thence
he was transferred to Naples, and,
after a captivity of five or six years,
was released by the arrival of Garibaldi.
“Oh, Mr Maguire,” exclaims
the author of the ‘Roba,’
“did you never suspect that if you
had the mischance to be a poor
Italian without parents or passport,
instead of a member of Parliament,
you might have been shown into
other rooms than the <i><span lang="it">‘Salone dei
Preti?’ Via!</span></i>” Why should Mr
Maguire trouble himself with such
inconvenient suspicions? He and
those who resemble him seek their
information in the highest quarter—namely,
from the Government;
and having, beforehand, an excellent
opinion of that Government,
they cannot think of suspecting it of
fraud or misstatement. Moreover
he might find in Rome countrymen
of his own, and possibly even some
Englishmen, ready to support him
in the belief that everything is for
the best under the pious and enlightened
rule of Antonelli. There
are always a few bitter Irish bigots
and zealous British perverts to be
met with in the Papal capital,
prompt to deny the existence of
abuses, and to extol the excellent
working of the priest-government
under which the unfortunate Romans
groan. They are made much
of by the Monsignori, and graciously
received by the Pope; and occasionally
they find means of making some
sort of demonstration which may be
magnified in partisan journals into
that of an important section of the
British residents in Rome. It was
an insignificant clique of this kind
which, about two years ago, scandalised
their countrymen in that
capital by waiting upon Francis II.
of Naples with expressions of sympathy
and good wishes.</p>

<p class='c009'>The author of the ‘Roba,’ who
does not dislike a good-natured hit
at his own countrymen’s peculiarities,
is amusing with respect to
their criticisms of the Colosseum,
the Campagna, and other principal
features of Rome and its environs.
One young lady told him she
thought the Colosseum “pretty,
but not so pretty as Naples;”
and a gentleman was of opinion
that it was less well built than
the custom-house in his native city,
of which the correct lines, sharp
angles, and whitewashed superficies
were doubtless more grateful
to his view than the ruins whose
abundance constitutes one of Rome’s
chief charms. There are people
who would be more struck with
the excellent workmanship and first-rate
bricks of the tall modern scarp
which supports a part of the Colosseum
that threatened to crumble
away, than they would be with its
ruined arches, its broken travertine
blocks, its time-worn cornices and
flower-draped benches, or than with
the lovely ruins of Caracalla’s baths,
concerning which Mr Story quotes
Shelley, whilst himself describing
them with much poetry of expression,
and a warm perception of the
beautiful. “Come with me,” he
says, “to the massive ruins of Caracalla’s
baths—climb its lofty arches
and creep along the broken roofs of
its perilous terraces. Golden gorses
and wallflowers blaze there in the
sun, out of reach; fig-trees, whose
fruit no hand can pluck, root themselves
in its clefts; pink sweetpeas
and every variety of creeping vetch
here bloom in perfection; tall grasses
wave their feathery plumes out
on dizzy and impracticable ledges;
and nature seems to have delighted
to twine this majestic ruin with its
loveliest flowers. Sit here, where
Shelley wrote the ‘Prometheus Unbound,’
and look out over the wide-stretching
Campagna.” And if you
have with you, as you ought to
have, when wandering over those
giddy arches and broken platforms,
the second volume of ‘Roba di
Roma,’ turn to page 97, and read its
accomplished author’s graphic and
glowing description of the view
thence obtained. Unfortunately
not all his countrymen possess the
same feeling for the beautiful in
nature—not all can find a charm in
a time-stained marble block, moss-mantled
and weed-entwined. To
one of Mr Story’s countrymen the
Colosseum was simply “an ugly,
pokerish place,” whilst another was
chiefly struck by its circular form,
and a third by the advantages it
offered for love-making—this last
being a recommendation, doubtless,
but one that can hardly have been
reckoned upon by the original designers
of the edifice. One gentleman
(we need not ask from which
side of the Atlantic) was liberal
enough to say, “I do not <em>object</em>,
sir, to the carnival at Rome;” and
Mr Story assures us that he knows
several who are equally indulgent
to the Colosseum and to St Peter’s.
He grieves to admit that English
and Americans too often speak ill
of the Campagna, which seems to
him, he declares, the most beautiful
and touching in its interest of
all places he has ever seen; but he
pillories a Frenchman who ventures
to despise it. The confident Gaul
had just come up from Naples, and
was asked if he had seen the grand
old temples at Pæstum. “<i><span lang="fr">Oui, monsieur</span></i>,”
was his answer, “<i><span lang="fr">j’ai vu le
Peste. C’est un pays détestable;
c’est comme la Campagne de Rome</span></i>.”
Detestable enough, no doubt, says
Story, after the fine military landscape
that surrounds Paris; “where
low bounding hills are flattened
like earthworks and bastions, and
stiff formal poplars are drawn up
in squares and columns on the wide
parade of its level and monotonous
plains. It is also a peculiarity of
the Frenchman that he underrates
everybody and everything except
himself and his country.” Mr Story
is too much in love with the Campagna
not to be jealous of its fame.
It is quite certain that, with many,
this is not so good as it deserves.
People who have not explored it
are apt to picture it to themselves
as a desolate tract, affording pasturage
but little wood, and exhaling
fever from every cleft in its soil.
When once they have driven and
ridden or walked (for much cannot
be done on wheels) over its varied
and picturesque surface, and seen it
in the fresh springtime, when its
green copses and hedges scent the
air, and its sward is diapered with
wild-flowers innumerable, many of
which are amongst the choice ones
of our English gardens, they are
lost in astonishment at the beauty
of the tract that surrounds Rome.
Our own original notion of the
Campagna was based on a picture
of a dreary expanse, over which the
first shades of night were spreading,
chasing thence the last deep red
glow of sunset; whilst in the centre
of the melancholy, treeless plain, a
peasant lad, in goat-skin breeks
and elf-locks, and suffering, apparently,
under a severe attack of jaundice,
tended a herd of pallid cattle,
which gave one the idea of having
just risen from the straw of sickness
in some bovine fever hospital. How
different this unprepossessing picture
was from the reality need not
be told to any who have taken the
trouble to visit the vicinity of Rome,
instead of limiting their daily exercise
(as some of the visitors to that
city most unwisely, both as regards
health and enjoyment, are prone to
do) to the small but agreeable garden
on the Pincian Hill, and to the
more extensive and certainly most
delightful grounds of the Villas
Borghese, Doria Pamphili, Albani,
and other residences of the Roman
princes. It would be tedious to
enumerate even the half of the
charming rides which are to be
had within twenty miles of Rome,
and which, it must be owned, the
younger portion of the floating
British population, both male and
female, generally make the most of
during the early spring months,
much more to their own pleasure
and benefit than to those of the
unfortunate hacks the Roman livery-stable
keepers annually provide for
the use of the <em>forestieri</em>. A regard
for truth compels us also to
declare that it is not the male portion
of the English at Rome that
those Campagna Rosinantes would,
could they speak their minds, most
object to carry. Rome—whose climate,
by the by, has been thought
by some to be generally more favourable
to women than to men—seems
to give our fair countrywomen
strength and endurance for an
amount of horse exercise they would
seldom take in England. Acting
upon the principle put into their
mouths by ‘Punch,’ “He’s a hoss,
and he must go,” they may be seen
daily urging their hired chargers
across the plain, and performing
their twenty-five or thirty miles,
chiefly at a canter, to and from the
various points of attraction, noted
sites, favourite picnic spots, and
the like, in the neighbourhood of
Rome, and coming in, glowing with
health, to dance half the night or
more at the numerous pleasant
parties given there during the first
three or four months of every year.
There used to be a subscription
pack of hounds in Rome, but the
sport was put a stop to, a few
seasons ago, in consequence of a
young member of the Roman aristocracy
having broken his neck
over a small ditch. Thereupon Pio
Nono forbade the sport, which was
considered rather hard upon the
English, who, as heretics, might
surely have been allowed to fracture
themselves to any extent without
causing much pain to his Holiness;
and, indeed, this feeling was so
general, that some were rather inclined
to attribute the interdiction
to Cardinal Antonelli’s sympathy
with the foxes. However that may
have been, there was no obtaining
a revocation of the edict, and the
hounds were sold—to be re-purchased,
perhaps, at a future day,
when the White Cross of Savoy
shall have replaced the Cross Keys
on the pinnacles of a liberated Rome.
The loss was a great one, however,
to the English; and even many of
the Italians deplored the stoppage
of the <i><span lang="it">mita</span></i>, as they called “the
meet,” which, however, with most
of the foreigners (that is to say, of
the non-English), was little more
than a pretext for picnics and flirtations.
Mr Story, with a few
humorous touches, gives us an excellent
idea of the <em>modus operandi</em>:—</p>

<p class='c010'>“The hounds bay and the hunt sweeps
off in the distance—now lost to sight, and
now emerging from the hollows. The
volunteers soon begin to return, and are
seen everywhere straggling about over
the slopes. The carriages move on, accompanying,
as they can, the hunt by
the road, till it strikes across the country
and is lost. The sunshine beats on
the mountains that quiver in soft purple;
larks sing in the air; Brown, Jones, and
Robinson ride by the side of the carriages
as they return, and Count Silinini
smiles, talks beautiful Italian, and
says, ‘Yas.’ He is a <i><span lang="it">guardia nobile</span></i>,
and comes to the house twice a week if
there are no balls, and dances with Marianne
at all the little hops. Signor
Somarino pays his court meanwhile to
Maria, who calls him Prince, emphasising
the title when she meets her friends
the Goony Browns. And so the hunting
picnic comes back to Rome.”</p>

<p class='c008'>As a writer, Mr Story’s strong
point is description of scenery, both
rural and urban. He is excellent
at a landscape; and, in the graphic
views he presents to us of Rome’s
streets and squares and fountains
and markets, beggars and models,
washerwomen and <em>pifferari</em>, he is
a compound of Prout and Pinelli.
From the very first page of the
book, one is attracted by the freshness
of his vocabulary and the
vividness of his style. With his
Cleopatra and Sybil bright in our
memory, we cannot think he mistook
his vocation when devoting
himself to sculpture; but certainly
the glow and choice of his literary
tints incline us to the belief that,
as a painter, he might have been
even more successful. We are unwilling
to quote extensively from a
book that will doubtless have been
read by many of our readers ere
this notice of it gets into their
hands, but there are fifty passages
that we are tempted to extract instead
of merely referring to them.
The first short chapter, “Entrance,”
contains more than one of these.
At page 11 we have a sketch of a
couple of the Abruzzi <em>pifferari</em>,
piping and blowing on their primitive
instruments before one of the
fifteen hundred Madonna shrines
of Rome—images of the Virgin,
with burning lamps, found in all
manner of places, at street corners,
down little lanes, in the heart of
the Corso, in the interior courts of
palaces, or on the staircases of
private houses—which places the
itinerants before us, in flesh and
blood, in their conical hats with
frayed feathers, red waistcoats and
skin sandals, <i><span lang="de">wie sie leibten und
lebten</span></i>, as the Germans say, the old
man with a sad amiable face, droning
out bass and treble in an earnest
and deprecatory manner, and the
younger vigorous player on the
<em>piffero</em>, “with a forest of tangled
black hair, and dark quick eyes
that were fixed steadily on the Virgin,
while he blew and vexed the
little brown pipe with rapid runs
and nervous <em>fioriture</em>, until great
drops of sweat dripped from its
round open mouth. Sometimes,
when he could not play fast enough
to satisfy his eagerness, he ran his
finger up and down the vents;
then, suddenly lowering his instrument,
he would scream, in a strong
peasant voice, verse after verse of
the <em>novena</em>, to the accompaniment
of the <em>zampogna</em> (bagpipe). One
was like a slow old Italian <i><span lang="la">vettura</span></i>,
all lumbered with luggage and held
back by its drag; the other panting
and nervous at his work as an
American locomotive, and as constantly
running off the rails. As
they stood there playing, a little
group gathered round. A scamp
of a boy left his sport to come and
beat time with a stick on the stone
step before them; several children
clustered near; and one or two
women, with black-eyed infants in
their arms, also paused to listen and
sympathise.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Every one who has been in Rome
during Advent has seen this group,
or one mighty like it and equally
characteristic. Turn to the book
(chapter on “Street Music in Rome”)
for the little scene that follows, for
the music of the <em>pifferari</em> song, and
for Mr Story’s conversation with
the enthusiastic piper, whom, with
his companions, he invited up into
his house, where they agreeably
stunned him with their noisy music,
to the delight of his children and
the astonishment of his servants, for
whom <em>piffero</em> and <em>zampogna</em> had
long since lost all charm, and who
doubtless looked upon their introduction
with somewhat of the same
feeling of disgust with which London
flunkies would behold that of a
couple of organ-grinders and a cage
of white mice into a Grosvenor
Square drawing-room. However,
Mr Story took down the words of
their quaint song, which we find
printed, probably for the first time,
in his book, and he also got from
them some curious particulars of
their wanderings. The man who
blew the little brown pipe was
quite a character. He and his
companion had played together for
three-and-thirty years, and their
sons, who presently came up, were
to play together with them. “For
thirty-three years more, let us
hope,” said Mr Story.</p>

<p class='c010'>“‘<i><span lang="it">Eh! Speriamo</span></i>’ (let us hope so), was
the answer of the <em>pifferaro</em>, as he showed
all his teeth in the broadest of smiles.
Then, with a motion of his hand, he set
both the young men going, he himself
joining in, straining out his cheeks,
blowing all the breath of his body into
the little pipe, and running up and
down the vents with a sliding finger,
until finally he brought up against a
high, shrill note, to which he gave the
full force of his lungs, and after holding
it in loud blast for a moment, startled
us by breaking off, without gradation,
into a silence as sudden as if the music
had snapped short off like a pipe-stem.”</p>

<p class='c008'>There are a great many stories
and incidents of and relating to
Rome and its inhabitants scattered
through the ‘Roba;’ and although to
us “old Romans,” not all of these
may be new, the majority of them
will be so to most readers, and they
are generally well told and <i><span lang="it">ben
trovate</span></i>. Amongst them we prefer
those little anecdotes and traits of
character which are evidently derived
from the writer’s personal
observation, and which, therefore,
as might be expected, are amongst
the most racy morsels in the book.
Take the following as an excellent
specimen of quiet humour—a strain
in which we like Mr Story better
than in his more buoyant mood:—</p>

<p class='c010'>“My friend Count Cignale is a painter—he
has a wonderful eye for colour and
an exquisite taste. He was making me
a visit the other day, and in strolling
about the neighbourhood we were
charmed with an old stone wall of as
many colours as Joseph’s coat: tender
greys, dashed with creamy yellows and
golden greens and rich subdued reds,
were mingled together in its plastered
stonework; above towered a row of glowing
oleanders covered with clusters of
roseate blossoms. Nothing would do but
that he must paint it, and so secure it
at once for his portfolio; for who knows,
said he, that the owner will not take it
into his head to whitewash it next
week, and ruin it? So he painted it,
and a beautiful picture it made. Within
a week the owner made a call on us.
He had seen Cignale painting his wall
with surprise, and deemed an apology
necessary. ‘I am truly sorry,’ he said,
‘that the wall is left in such a condition.
It ought to be painted all over with a
uniform tint, and I will do it at once.
I have long had this intention, and I
will no longer omit to carry it into
effect.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘Let us beseech you,’ we both cried
at once, ‘<i><span lang="it">caro conte mio</span></i>, to do no such
thing, for you will ruin your wall.
What! whitewash it over!—it is profanation,
sacrilege, murder, and arson.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“He opened his eyes. ‘Ah! I did
not mean to whitewash it, but to wash
it over with a pearl colour,’ he answered.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘Whatever you do to it you will
spoil it. Pray let it alone. It is beautiful
now.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘Is it, indeed?’ he cried. ‘Well,

<p class='c008'>The preceding scrap reminds us
of a passage from Alphonse Karr,
one of the most quietly-humorous
of living French writers, who relates,
in one of his quaint, dreamy,
desultory books, how a neighbour
of his, who lived in a poor
thatched cottage on the fringe of
a wood, embowered in flowers,
shaded by venerable trees, refreshed
by the balmiest of breezes, and enlivened
by the songs of countless
birds, suddenly disappeared from
the countryside. Karr, who had
long admired the sylvan retreat,
and almost envied its occupant, inquired
his fate. He had become
rich, he was told; a legacy had enabled
him to go and live in the
town. He could afford to rent two
rooms with new furniture and a
gaudy paper, and he looked out
upon a dirty street, along which
omnibuses continually rolled. “Poor
rich man!” Karr pitying exclaims.
He had whitewashed his wall.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Roman Ghetto furnishes the
theme of one of Mr Story’s longest
and most lively chapters; Fountains
and Aqueducts, Saints and
Superstitions, the Evil Eye, are
the titles of three others. He begins
his second volume with a vivid
and characteristic sketch of the
Markets of Rome, which are well
worth the attention of foreign
visitors, especially of Englishmen,
who will find their arrangements,
and much of what is there sold, to
contrast strikingly with what they
are accustomed to in their own
country. Carcasses of pigs and
goats adorned with scraps of gold-leaf
and tinsel, blood puddings of a
brilliant crimson, poultry sold by
retail—that is to say, piecemeal, so
that you may buy a wing, a leg, or
even the head or gizzard of a fowl,
if so it please you. There is game
of all sorts, and queer beasts and
fowls of many kinds are also there;
the wild boar rough and snarling—the
slender tawny deer—porcupines
(commonly eaten in Rome)—most of
our English game-birds—ortolans,
beccaficoes, and a great variety of
singing-birds. Passing into the fruit
and vegetable market, one comes
upon mushrooms of many colours,
and some of them of enormous size,
most of which would in England
be looked upon as sudden death
to the consumer, although in Italy
they are found both savoury and
harmless. “Here are the grey <i><span lang="it">porcini</span></i>,
the foliated <i><span lang="it">alberetti</span></i>, and the
orange-hued <em>ovole</em>; some of the
latter of enormous size, big enough
to shelter a thousand fairies under
their smooth and painted domes.
In each of these is a cleft stick,
bearing a card from the inspector
of the market, granting permission
to sell; for mushrooms have proved
fatal to so many cardinals, to say
nothing of popes and people, that
they are naturally looked upon with
suspicion, and must all be officially
examined to prevent accidents.”
Besides the fruits common in England,
figs are very abundant, and
of many kinds; and when the good
ones come in, in September, the
Romans of the lower classes assemble
in the evenings, in the
Piazza Navona, for great feeds upon
them. Five or six persons surround
a great basket and eat it
empty, correcting possible evil results
by a glass of strong waters or
a flask of red wine. But figs are
a wholesome fruit—much more so
than one which at Rome, and in
many parts of Southern Europe, is
the most popular of all—namely,
the water-melon. What millions
of people, from the Danube’s banks
to the Portuguese coast, are daily
refreshed the summer through by
those huge green gourds, hard and
unpromising in outward aspect, but
revealing, at stroke of knife, rich
store of rosy pulp, dotted with
sable seeds! Pesth is a great place
for them; and daily, when morning
breaks, so long as they are in season,
they are to be seen piled, all
along the river-side, in heaps like
those of shot and shell in an arsenal,
only much broader and higher.
All through the hot months, in
Hungary’s pleasant and interesting
capital, few persons think of
dining without associating with the
more heating viands a moiety or
enormous segment of one of those
great cold fruits—a strange digestive,
as we Northerners should consider
it, but found to answer well
in sultry climes. At Rome they
are equally appreciated, and are
set above the choicest grapes.
People make parties to go out
of the city and eat them; and this
was especially the case some years
ago, when the authorities forbade
their entrance on account of the
cholera, but were unable to prevent
their extramural consumption. In
ordinary times you find heaps of
them in the streets, especially in the
Piazza Navona, that great mart of
fruit and frippery, vegetables, old
books, brilliant handkerchiefs, and
other finery for the market-women—old
iron, old bottles, and rubbish
of all kinds—amongst which miscellany
the patient investigator may
sometimes discover valuable copies
of the classic authors and precious
antique <em>intagli</em>, to be purchased for
a mere song. Here, as the story
goes, a poor priest once bought, for
a few <i><span lang="it">baiocchi</span></i>, a large cut-glass bead
which took his fancy, and which a
friend, more knowing than himself,
afterwards discovered to be a diamond
of great value, now belonging,
we are told, to the Emperor of Russia.
The priest disappeared, which
leaves any ingenious and inventive
writer full liberty to build a romantic
tale upon the incident. The
natural finale of the affair, Mr Story
opines, would have been for the
priest to have married the Emperor’s
daughter, but his being in orders
was an impediment; and so we are
justified in presuming that some
less agreeable means was found of
easing him of his jewel, which, when
he first possessed it, he took to be a
drop from a chandelier, but to which
he of course clung with desperate
tenacity when enlightened as to the
quality of the gem. Rome ought to
be a good preserve for fiction-writers,
there are so many family histories,
traditions, and anecdotes current
there, which would serve the novelist’s
turn. Edmund About availed
himself of one such in his tale of
‘Tolla;’ and another over-true tale
was interwoven, not very long since,
in a pleasant novelet of Roman life
in the pages of this Magazine. Mr
Story’s volumes abound in suggestive
passages of the kind. If Rome
be an admirable residence for an
artist (and for some of the reasons
why it is so, see the ‘Roba,’ i. p. 66,
67), it ought also to be an excellent
one for a writer, were it not that it
is found by many unfavourable to
mental exertion. This is said to be
particularly exemplified in the case
of diplomatists, many of whom, after
a certain time passed in the Papal
capital, are apt to conceive an intense
dislike to despatch-writing,
and to keep their Governments extremely
uninformed concerning the
state of the Holy City and the
prospects of Pontifical politics. We
remember to have been told, when
in Rome, the names of more than
one foreign minister who had been
recalled, it was asserted, for no other
reason but that nothing could induce
him to write despatches. Rome
is certainly one of the places where
there is most temptation, at least
for one half of the year, to neglect
business for pleasure; but there is
possibly also something in the climate
which disinclines many people
to headwork. It is much the fashion
to abuse the Roman climate; and
this has been done, especially of late,
by persons desirous to show that
Rome is an undesirable, because a
highly insalubrious, capital for
united Italy. It is to be feared the
grapes are sour, and that the yellow
flag now hoisted would be struck at
the same time with the French tricolour.
Our own experience and
observations induce us very much
to concur with those passages of Mr
Story’s book which relate to this
question. “Rome has, with strangers,
the reputation of being unhealthy;
but this opinion I cannot
think well founded—to the extent,
at least, of the common belief.”
Many maladies, virulent and dangerous
elsewhere, are very light in
Rome; and for lung complaints it
is well known that people repair
thither. The “Roman fever,” as
it is commonly called (intermittent
and <i><span lang="it">perniciosa</span></i>), is seldom suffered
from by the better classes of Romans;
and Mr Story (who speaks with
authority after his many years’
residence in Rome) believes that,
with a little prudence, it may easily
be avoided. The peasants of the
Campagna are, it is well known,
those who chiefly suffer from it, and
why? “Their food is poor, their
habits careless, their labour exhausting
and performed in the sun, and
they sleep often on the bare ground
or a little straw. And yet, despite
the life they lead and their various
exposures, they are, for the most
part, a very strong and sturdy class.”
Mr Story gives it as a fact that the
French soldiers who besieged Rome
in ‘48, during the summer months,
suffered very little from fever, although
sleeping out on the Campagna;
but they were better clothed
and fed, and altogether more careful
of themselves, than the native
peasants. Generally speaking, the
foreigners who visit Rome are less
attentive than the Romans to certain
common rules for the preservation
of health. They eat and drink too
much, and of the wrong things.
They get hot, and then plunge into
cold churches or galleries; whereas
an Italian flies from a chill or
current of air as from infection. Mr
Story gives a few simple rules, by
following which he declares you
may live twenty years in Rome without
a fever. He cautions Englishmen
against copious dinners, sherry
and brandy, and his own countrymen
against the morning-dinner
which they call a breakfast; and
supplies other useful hints and
practical remarks. The subject is
one which interests many, and such
are referred to the ‘Roba,’ i. p. 156–161,
and to the chapter on the Campagna,
in which high authorities and
ingenious arguments are brought to
prove that in old times it was not
insalubrious, and that in our own
it need not be so. Population and
cultivation are perhaps all that are
needed to render tracts healthy that
now are pestilential, but which
assuredly were not so in the time
of the ancient Romans, since many
of them, we know, were their favourite
sites for patrician villas.
Much might be done by an intelligent
and active government, and
especially by a good sanitary commission.
There was one clever
gentleman who wrote that Rome
was ill fitted to be the capital of
Italy on account of its deficiency in
buildings suitable for government
offices! Where good reasons are
not to be found silly ones may be
resorted to, but they of course only
weaken the cause they are intended
to prop. And if it were to be urged
that all the worst plagues flesh is
heir to, combine to render Rome for
the present impossible as capital
of Italy, the most we could admit,
by way of compromise, and borrowing
a well-known answer, would be,
“<i><span lang="it">non tutti, ma Buona parte</span></i>.”</p>

</div>

<h3 class='c017'>NO. XX.—ON SELF-CONTROL.</h3>

<p class='c018'>“He who desires to influence
others must learn to command himself,”
is an old aphorism, on which,
perhaps, something new may be
said. In the ordinary ethics of the
nursery, self-control means little
more than a check upon temper.
A wise restraint, no doubt; but as
useful to the dissimulator as to
the honest man. I do not necessarily
conquer my anger because I
do not show that I am angry. Anger
vented often hurries towards forgiveness;
anger concealed often
hardens into revenge.</p>

<p class='c009'>A hasty temper is not the only
horse that runs away with the charioteer
on the Road of Life. Nor
is it the most dangerous, for it seldom
runs away far. It gives a jerk
and a shake; but it does not take
the bit between its teeth, and gallop
blindly on, mile after mile, in one
obstinate direction towards a precipice.
A hasty temper is an infirmity
disagreeable to others, undignified
in ourselves—a fault so well
known to every man who has it,
that he will at once acknowledge
it to be a fault which he ought to
correct. He requires, therefore, no
moralising essayist to prove to him
his failing, or teach him his duty.
But still a hasty temper is a frank
offender, and has seldom that injurious
effect either on the welfare
of others, or on our own natures,
mental and moral, which results
from the steady purpose of one of
those vices which are never seen in
a passion.</p>

<p class='c009'>In social intercourse, if his character
be generous and his heart
sound, a man does not often lose a
true friend from a quick word. And
even in the practical business of
life, wherein an imperturbable temper
is certainly a priceless advantage,
a man of honesty and talent
may still make his way without it.
Nay, he may inspire a greater trust
in his probity and candour, from
the heat he displays against trickiness
and falsehood. Indeed there
have been consummate masters in
the wisdom of business who had
as little command of temper as if
Seneca and Epictetus had never
proved the command of temper to
be the first business of wisdom.
Richelieu strode towards his public
objects with a footstep unswervingly
firm, though his servants found it
the easiest thing in the world to
put him into a passion. Sometimes
they did so on purpose, pleased to
be scolded unjustly, because sure of
some handsome amends. And in
treating of self-control, I am contented
to take that same Richelieu, the
Cardinal, as an illustration of the
various and expansive meaning
which I give to the phrase. Richelieu
did not command his temper
in the sphere of his private household:
he commanded it to perfection
in his administration of a kingdom.
He was cruel, but from policy,
not from rage. Among all the victims
of that policy, there was not
one whose doom could be ascribed
to his personal resentments. The
life of no subject, and the success of
no scheme, depended on the chance
whether the irritable minister was
in good or bad humour. If he permitted
his temper free vent in his
household, it was because there
he was only a private individual.
There, he could indulge in the
luxury of ire without disturbing
the mechanism of the state. There,
generous as a noble and placable as
a priest, he could own himself in
the wrong, and beg his servants’
forgiveness, without lowering the
dignity of the minister, who, when
he passed his threshold, could ask
no pardon from others, and acknowledge
no fault in himself. It was
there where his emotions were most
held in restraint,—there where, before
the world’s audience, his mind
swept by concealed in the folds of
its craft, as, in Victor Hugo’s great
drama, <cite><span lang="fr">L’Homme Rouge</span></cite> passes across
the stage, curtained round in his
litter, a veiled symbol of obscure,
inexorable, majestic fate,—it was
there where the dread human being
seemed to have so mastered his
thoughts and his feelings, that they
served but as pulleys and wheels to
the bloodless machine of his will,—it
was there that self-control was
in truth the most feeble. And this
apparent paradox brings me at once
to the purpose for which my essay
is written.</p>

<p class='c009'>What is <span class='sc'>Self</span>? What is that
many-sided Unity which is centred
in the single Ego of a man’s being?
I do not put the question metaphysically.
Heaven forbid! The
problem it involves provokes the
conjectures of all schools, precisely
because it has received no solution
from any. The reader is welcome
to whatever theory he may
prefer to select from metaphysical
definitions, provided that he will
acknowledge in the word Self the
representation of an integral individual
human being—the organisation
of a certain fabric of flesh and
blood, biassed, perhaps, originally
by the attributes and peculiarities
of the fabric itself—by hereditary
predispositions, by nervous idiosyncrasies,
by cerebral developments,
by slow or quick action of the pulse,
by all in which mind takes a shape
from the mould of the body;—but
still a Self which, in every sane
constitution, can be changed or
modified from the original bias, by
circumstance, by culture, by reflection,
by will, by conscience, through
means of the unseen inhabitant of
the fabric. Not a man has ever
achieved a something good or
great, but will own that, before he
achieved it, his mind succeeded in
conquering or changing some predisposition
of body.</p>

<p class='c009'>True self-control, therefore, is the
control of that entire and complex
unity, the individual Self. It necessitates
an accurate perception of
all that is suggested by the original
bias, and a power to adapt and to
regulate, or to oppose and divert,
every course to which that bias inclines
the thought and impels the
action.</p>

<p class='c009'>For Self, left to itself, only crystallises
atoms homogeneous to its
original monad. A nature constitutionally
proud and pitiless, intuitively
seeks, in all the culture it
derives from intellectual labour, to
find reasons to continue proud and
pitiless—to extract from the lessons
of knowledge arguments by which
to justify its impulse, and rules by
which the impulse can be drilled
into method and refined into policy.</p>

<p class='c009'>Among the marvels of psychology,
certainly not the least astounding
is that facility with which the
conscience, being really sincere in
its desire of right, accommodates
itself to the impulse which urges it
to go wrong. It is thus that fanatics,
whether in religion or in politics,
hug as the virtue of saints and
heroes the barbarity of the bigot,
the baseness of the assassin. No
one can suppose that Calvin did
not deem that the angels smiled
approbation when he burned Servetus.
No one can suppose that
when Torquemada devised the Inquisition,
he did not conscientiously
believe that the greatest happiness
of the greatest number could be
best secured by selecting a few for
a roast. Torquemada could have
no personal interest in roasting a
heretic; Torquemada did not eat
him when roasted; Torquemada
was not a cannibal.</p>

<p class='c009'>Again: no one can suppose that
when the German student, Sand,
after long forethought, and with
cool determination, murdered a
writer whose lucubrations shocked
his political opinions, he did not
walk to the scaffold with a conscience
as calm as that of the mildest
young lady who ever slaughtered
a wasp from her fear of its
sting.</p>

<p class='c009'>So when Armand Richelieu
marched inflexibly to his public
ends, the spy on his left side, the
executioner on his right, Bayard
could not have felt himself more
free from stain and reproach. His
conscience would have found in his
intellect not an accusing monitor
but a flattering parasite. It would
have whispered in his ear—“Great
Man—Hero, nay, rather Demigod<a id='r5'></a><a href='#f5' class='c007'><sup>[5]</sup></a>—to
destroy is thy duty, because to
reconstruct is thy mission. The
evils which harass the land—for
which Heaven, that gave thee so
dauntless a heart and so scheming a
brain, has made thee responsible—result
from the turbulent ambition
of nobles who menace the throne
thou art deputed to guard, and the
licence of pestilent schisms at war
with the Church of which thou art
the grace and the bulwark. Pure
and indefatigable patriot, undeterred
by the faults of the sovereign
who hates thee, by the sins of the
people who would dip their hands
in thy blood, thou toilest on in thy
grand work serenely, compelling
the elements vainly conflicting
against thee into the unity of
thine own firm design—unity secular,
unity spiritual—one throne
safe from rebels, one church free
from schisms; in the peace of that
unity, the land of thy birth will collect
and mature and concentrate its
forces, now wasted and waning, till
it rise to the rank of the one state
of Europe—the brain and the heart
of the civilised world! No mythical
Hercules thou! Complete thy
magnificent labours. Purge the
land of the Lion and Hydra—of
the throne-shaking Baron—the
church-splitting Huguenot!”</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f5'>
<p class='c009'><a href='#r5'>5</a>. An author dedicated a work to Richelieu. In the dedication, referring to the
‘Siege of Rochelle,’ he complimented the Cardinal with the word Hero. When the
dedication was submitted to Richelieu for approval, he scratched out “Hèros,” and
substituted “Demi-Dieu!”</p>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Armand Richelieu, by nature not
vindictive nor mean, thus motions
without remorse to the headsman,
listens without shame to the spy,
and, when asked on his deathbed
if he forgave his enemies, replies,
conscientiously ignorant of his many
offences against the brotherhood
between man and man, “I owe no
forgiveness to enemies; I never had
any except those of the State.”</p>

<p class='c009'>For human governments, the
best statesman is he who carries a
keen perception of the common interests
of humanity into all his projects,
howsoever intellectually subtle.
But that policy is not for the
interests of humanity which cannot
be achieved without the spy and
the headsman. And those projects
cannot serve humanity which sanction
persecution as the instrument
of truth, and subject the fate of a
community to the accident of a
benevolent despot.</p>

<p class='c009'>In Richelieu there was no genuine
self-control, because he had
made his whole self the puppet of
certain fixed and tyrannical ideas.
Now, in this the humblest and obscurest
individual amongst us is
too often but a Richelieu in miniature.
Every man has in his own
temperament peculiar propellers to
the movement of his thoughts and
the choice of his actions. Every man
has his own favourite ideas rising
out of his constitutional bias. At
the onset of life this bias is clearly
revealed to each. No youth ever
leaves college but what he is perfectly
aware of the leading motive-properties
of his own mind. He
knows whether he is disposed by
temperament to be timid or rash,
proud or meek, covetous of approbation
or indifferent to opinion,
thrifty or extravagant, stern in his
justice or weak in his indulgence.
It is while his step is yet on the
threshold of life that man can best
commence the grand task of self-control;
for then he best adjusts
that equilibrium of character by
which he is saved from the despotism
of one ruling passion or the
monomania of one cherished train
of ideas. Later in life our introvision
is sure to be obscured—the
intellect has familiarised itself to
its own errors, the conscience is
deafened to its own first alarms;
and the more we cultivate the intellect
in its favourite tracks, the
more we question the conscience in
its own prejudiced creed, so much
the more will the intellect find skilful
excuses to justify its errors, so
much the more will the conscience
devise ingenious replies to every
doubt we submit to the casuistry
of which we have made it the adept.</p>

<p class='c009'>Nor is it our favourite vices alone
that lead us into danger—noble
natures are as liable to be led astray
by their favourite virtues; for it is
the proverbial tendency of a virtue
to fuse itself insensibly into its
neighbouring vice; and, on the
other hand, in noble natures, a
constitutional vice is often drilled
into a virtue.</p>

<p class='c009'>But few men can attain that
complete subjugation of self to the
harmony of moral law, which was
the aim of the Stoics. A mind so
admirably balanced that each attribute
of character has its just weight
and no more, is rather a type of
ideal perfection, than an example
placed before our eyes in the actual
commerce of life. I must narrow
the scope of my homily, and suggest
to the practical a few practical
hints for the ready control of their
faculties.</p>

<p class='c009'>It seems to me that a man will
best gain command over those intellectual
faculties which he knows
are his strongest, by cultivating the
faculties that somewhat tend to
counterbalance them. He in whom
imagination is opulent and fervid
will regulate and discipline its exercise
by forcing himself to occupations
or studies that require plain
common sense. He who feels that
the bias of his judgment or the tendency
of his avocations is over-much
towards the positive and anti-poetic
forms of life, will best guard against
the narrowness of scope and feebleness
of grasp which characterise
the intellect that seeks common
sense only in commonplace, by
warming his faculties in the glow
of imaginative genius; he should
not forget that where heat enters it
expands. And, indeed, the rule I
thus lay down, eminent men have
discovered for themselves. Men
of really great imagination will be
found to have generally cultivated
some branch of knowledge that requires
critical or severe reasoning.
Men of really great capacities for
practical business will generally be
found to indulge in a predilection for
works of fancy. The favourite reading
of poets or fictionists of high
order will seldom be poetry or fiction.
Poetry or fiction is to them a study,
not a relaxation. Their favourite
reading will be generally in works
called abstruse or dry—antiquities,
metaphysics, subtle problems of
criticism, or delicate niceties of
scholarship. On the other hand,
the favourite reading of celebrated
lawyers is generally novels. Thus
in every mind of large powers there
is an unconscious struggle perpetually
going on to preserve its equilibrium.
The eye soon loses its justness
of vision if always directed
towards one object at the same
distance—the soil soon exhausts
its produce if you draw from it
but one crop.</p>

<p class='c009'>But it is not enough to secure
counteraction for the mind in all
which directs its prevailing faculties
towards partial and special results;
it is necessary also to acquire
the power to keep differing faculties
and acquirements apart and
distinct on all occasions in which it
would be improper to blend them.
When the poet enters on the stage
of real life as a practical man of
business, he must be able to leave
his poetry behind him; when the
practical man of business enters
into the domain of poetry, he must
not remind us that he is an authority
on the Stock Exchange. In a
word, he who has real self-control
has all his powers at his command,
now to unite and now to separate
them.</p>

<p class='c009'>In public life this is especially
requisite. A statesman is seldom
profound unless he be somewhat of
a scholar; an orator is seldom eloquent
unless he have familiarised
himself with the world of the poets.
But he will never be a statesman
of commanding influence, and never
an orator of lasting renown, if, in
action or advice on the practical
affairs of nations, he be more
scholar or poet than orator or statesman.
Pitt and Fox are memorable
instances of the discriminating self-abnegation
with which minds of
masculine power can abstain from
the display of riches unsuited to
place and occasion.</p>

<p class='c009'>In the Mr Fox of St Stephen’s,
the nervous reasoner from premises
the broadest and most popular, there
is no trace of the Mr Fox of St
Anne’s, the refining verbal critic,
with an almost feminine delight in
the filigree and trinkets of literature.
At rural leisure, under his
apple-blossoms, his predilection in
scholarship is for its daintiest
subtleties; his happiest remarks
are on writers very little read. But
place the great Tribune on the floor
of the House of Commons, and not
a vestige of the fine verbal critic is
visible. His classical allusions are
then taken from passages the most
popularly known. And, indeed, it
was a saying of Fox’s, “That no
young member should hazard in
Parliament a Latin quotation not
found in the Eton Grammar.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Pitt was yet more sparing than
Fox in the exhibition of his scholarship,
which, if less various than his
rival’s, was probably quite as deep.
And one of the friends who knew
him best said, that Pitt rigidly subdued
his native faculty of <em>wit</em>, not
because he did not appreciate and
admire its sparkles in orators unrestrained
by the responsibilities of
office, but because he considered
that a man in the position of First
Minister impaired influence and authority
by the cheers that transferred
his reputation from his rank of Minister
to his renown as Wit. He was
right. Grave situations are not only
dignified but strengthened by that
gravity of demeanour which is not
the hypocrisy of the would-be wise,
but the genuine token of the earnest
sense of responsibility.</p>

<p class='c009'>Self-control thus necessitates, first,
Self-Knowledge—the consciousness
and the calculation of our own resources
and our own defects. Every
man has his strong point—every
man has his weak ones. To know
both the strong point and the weak
ones is the first object of the man
who means to extract from himself
the highest degree of usefulness with
the least alloy of mischief. His next
task is yet more to strengthen his
strong points by counterbalancing
them with weights thrown into the
scale of the weak ones; for force is
increased by resistance. Remedy
your deficiencies, and your merits
will take care of themselves. Every
man has in him good and evil. His
good is his valiant army, his evil
is his corrupt commissariat; reform
the commissariat, and the army will
do its duty.</p>

<p class='c009'>The third point in Self-control is
Generalship—is Method—is that
calm science in the midst of movement
and passion which decides
where to advance, where to retreat—what
regiments shall lead the
charge, what regiments shall be
held back in reserve. This is the
last and the grandest secret: the
other two all of us may master.</p>

<p class='c009'>The man who, but with a mind
somewhat above the average (raised
above the average whether by constitutional
talent or laborious acquirement),
has his own intellect,
with all its stores, under his absolute
control,—that man can pass
from one state of idea to another—from
action to letters, from letters
to action—without taking from one
the establishment that would burden
the other. It is comparatively
a poor proprietor who cannot move
from town to country but what he
must carry with him all his servants
and half his furniture. He
who keeps the treasures he has inherited
or saved in such compartments
that he may know where to
look for each at the moment it is
wanted, will rarely find himself misplaced
in any change of situation.
It is not that his genius is versatile,
but that it has the opulent attributes
which are essential to successful
intellect of every kind. The
attributes themselves may vary in
property and in degree, but the
power of the <span class='sc'>Self</span>—of the unity
which controls all at its disposal—should
be in the facility with which
it can separate or combine all its
attributes at its will.</p>

<p class='c009'>It is thus, in the natural world,
that an ordinary chemist may accomplish
marvels beyond the art of
magicians of old. Each man of
good understanding, who would be
as a chemist to the world within
himself, will be startled to discover
what new agencies spring into action
merely by separating the elements
dormant when joined, or
combining those that were wasted
in air when apart. In one completed
Man there are the forces of
many men. Self-control is self-completion.</p>

<h3 class='c019'>NO. XXI.—THE MODERN MISANTHROPE.</h3>

<p class='c018'>“All the passions,” saith an old
writer, “are such near neighbours,
that if one of them is on fire the
others should send for the buckets.”
Thus love and hate being both passions,
the one is never safe from
the spark that sets the other ablaze.
But contempt is passionless; it does
not catch, it quenches fire. The
misanthrope who professes to hate
mankind has generally passed to
that hate from too extravagant a
love. And love for mankind is
still, though unconsciously to himself,
feeding hate by its own unextinguished
embers. “The more a
man loves his mistress,” says Rochefoucauld,
“the nearer he is to hate
her.” Possibly so, if he is jealous;
but in return, the more he declares
he hates her, the nearer he is to
loving her again. Vehement affections
do not move in parallels but
in circles. As applied to them the
proverb is true, “<i><span lang="fr">Les extrêmes se
touchent</span></i>.” A man of ardent temperament
who is shocked into misanthropy
by instances of ingratitude
and perfidy, is liable any day
to be carried back into philanthropy,
should unlooked-for instances of
gratitude and truth start up and
take him by surprise. But if an
egotist, who, inheriting but a small
pittance of human affection, concentres
it rigidly on himself, should
deliberately school his reason into
calm contempt for his species, he
will retain that contempt to the
last. He looks on the world of
man, with its virtues and vices,
much as you, O my reader, look on
an ant-hill! What to you are the
virtues or vices of ants? It is this
kind of masked misanthropy which
we encounter in our day—the misanthropy
without a vizard belongs
to a ruder age.</p>

<p class='c009'>The misanthrope of Shakespeare
and Molière is a passionate savage;
the misanthrope who has just kissed
his hand to you is a polished gentleman.
No disgust of humanity will
ever make <em>him</em> fly the world. From
his club-window in St James’s his
smile falls on all passers-by with
equal suavity and equal scorn. It
may be said by verbal critics that I
employ the word misanthrope incorrectly—that,
according to strict
interpretation, a misanthrope means
not a despiser but a hater of men,
and that this elegant gentleman is
not, by my own showing, warmblooded
enough for hate. True,
but contempt so serene and immovable
is the philosophy of hate—the
intellectual consummation of misanthropy.
My hero would have
listened with approving nod to all
that Timon or Alceste could have
thundered forth in detestation of
his kind, and blandly rejoined,
“Your truisms, <i><span lang="fr">mon cher</span></i>, are as
evident as that two and two make
four. But you can calculate on the
principle that two and two make
four without shouting forth, as if
you proclaimed a notable discovery,
what every one you meet knows as
well as yourself. Men are scoundrels—two
and two make four—reckon
accordingly, and don’t lose
your temper in keeping your accounts.”
My misanthrope <i><span lang="fr">à la
mode</span></i> never rails at vice; he takes it
for granted as the elementary principle
in the commerce of life. As
for virtue, he regards it as a professor
of science regards witchcraft.
No doubt there are many plausible
stories, very creditably attested,
that vouch for its existence, but
the thing is not in nature. Easier
to believe in a cunning imposture
than an impossible fact. It is the
depth and completeness of his contempt
for the world that makes him
take the world so pleasantly. He
is deemed the man of the world
<em>par excellence</em>, and the World caresses
and admires its Man.</p>

<p class='c009'>The finest gentleman of my young
day, who never said to you an unkind
thing nor of you a kind one—whose
slightest smile was a seductive
fascination—whose loudest
tone was a flute-like melody—had
the sweetest way possible of insinuating
his scorn of the human
race. The urbanity of his manners
made him a pleasant acquaintance—the
extent of his reading an accomplished
companion. No one
was more versed in those classes of
literature in which Mephistopheles
might have sought polite authorities
in favour of his demoniacal
views of philosophy. He was at
home in the correspondence between
cardinals and debauchees in
the time of Leo X. He might have
taken high honours in an examination
on the memoirs illustrating
the life of French <i><span lang="fr">salons</span></i> in the <i><span lang="fr">ancien
régime</span></i>. He knew the age of
Louis Quinze so well that to hear
him you might suppose he was just
fresh from a <i><span lang="fr">petit souper</span></i> in the <i><span lang="fr">Parc
aux Cerfs</span></i>.</p>

<p class='c009'>Too universally agreeable not to
amuse those present at the expense
of those absent, still, even in sarcasm,
he never seemed to be ill-natured.
As one of his associates
had a louder reputation for wit
than his own, so it was his modest
habit to father upon that professed
<i><span lang="fr">diseur de bons mots</span></i> any more pointed
epigram that occurred spontaneously
to himself. “I wonder,” said a
dandy of another dandy who was
no Adonis, “why on earth —— has
suddenly taken to cultivate those
monstrous red whiskers.” “Ah,”
quoth my pleasant fine gentleman,
“I think for my part they become
his style of face very much; A——
says ‘that they plant out his ugliness.’”
For the rest, in all graver
matters, if the man he last dined
with committed some act which all
honest men blamed, my misanthrope
evinced his gentle surprise,
not at the act, but the blame—“What
did you expect?” he would
say, with an adorable indulgence,
“he was a man—<em>like yourselves</em>!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Sprung from one of the noblest
lineages in Christendom—possessed
of a fortune which he would smilingly
say “was not large enough
to allow him to give a shilling to
any one else,” but which, prudently
spent on himself, amply sufficed for
all the elegant wants of a man so
emphatically single—this darling
of fashion had every motive conceivable
to an ordinary understanding
not to be himself that utter
rogue which he assumed every other
fellow-creature to be. Nevertheless,
he was too nobly consistent to
his creed to suffer his example to
be at variance with his doctrine;
and here he had an indisputable
advantage over Timon and Alceste,
who had no right, when calling all
men rogues, to belie their assertion
by declining to be rogues themselves.
His favourite amusement
was whist, and in that game his
skill was so consummate that he
had only to play fairly in order to
add to his income a sum which,
already spending on himself all that
he himself required, he would not
have known what to do with. But,
as he held all men to be cheats, he
cheated on principle. It was due
to the honour of his philosophy
to show his utter disdain of the
honour which impostors preached,
but which only dupes had the folly
to practise. If others did not mark
the aces and shuffle up the kings as
he did, it was either because they
were too stupid to learn how, or too
cowardly to risk the chance of exposure.
He was not as stupid, he
was not as cowardly, as the generality
of men. It became him to
show his knowledge of their stupidity
and his disdain of their cowardice.
<i><span lang="fr">Bref</span></i>—he cheated!—long
with impunity: but, as Charron
says, <i><span lang="fr">L’homme se pique</span></i>—man cogs
the dice for his own ruin. At last
he was suspected, he was watched,
he was detected. But the first
thought of his fascinated victims
was not to denounce, but to warn
him—kindly letters conveying delicate
hints were confidentially sent
to him: he was not asked to disgorge,
not exhorted to repent; let
bygones be bygones, only for the
future, would he, in playing with
his intimate associates, good-naturedly
refrain from marking the
aces and shuffling up the kings?</p>

<p class='c009'>I can well imagine the lofty smile
with which the scorner of men must
have read such frivolous recommendations
to depart from the philosophical
system adorned in vain by his
genius if not enforced by his example.
He who despised the opinions
of sages and saints—he to be frightened
into respecting the opinions
of idlers at a club!—send to him
an admonition from the world of
honour, to respect the superstitions
of card-players! as well send to Mr
Faraday an admonition from the
world of spirits to respect the
superstitions of table-rappers! To
either philosopher there would be
the same reply—“I go by the laws
of nature.” In short, strong in the
conscience of his opinion, this consistent
reasoner sublimely persevered
in justifying his theories of
misanthropy by his own resolute
practice of knavery, inexcusable and
unredeemed.</p>

<p class='c009'>But man, whatever his inferiority
to the angels, is still not altogether
a sheep. And even a sheep only
submits to be sheared once a year;
to be sheared every day would irritate
the mildest of lambs. Some of
the fellow-mortals whom my hero
smiled on and plundered, took heart,
and openly accused him of marking
the aces and shuffling up the kings.
At first his native genius suggested
to him the wisdom of maintaining,
in smiling silence, the contempt of
opinion he had hitherto so superbly
evinced. Unhappily for himself, he
was induced by those who, persuaded
that a man of so high a
birth could never have stooped to
so low a peccadillo, flattered him
with the assurance of an easy triumph
over his aspersers—unhappily,
I say, he was induced into a
departure from that system of action
which he had hitherto maintained
with so supreme a success.
He condescended, for the first time
in his life, to take other men into
respect—to regard what might be
thought of him by a world he despised.
He brought an action for
libel against his accusers. His counsel,
doubtless by instruction, sought
to redeem that solitary inconsistency
in his client, by insinuating
that my lord’s chosen associates
were themselves the cheats, malignant
conspirators against the affable
hawk of quality in whom they had
expected to find a facile pigeon.</p>

<p class='c009'>The cuttle-fish blackens the water
to escape from his enemies, but he
does not always escape; nay, in
blackening the water he betrays
himself to the watchful spectators.
My hero failed in his action, and
quitted the court leaving behind
him the bubble reputation. If I
am rightly informed, Adversity, that
touchstone of lofty minds, found
this grand philosopher as serene as
if he had spent his life in studying
Epictetus. He wrapt himself, if
not in virtue, at least in his scorn
of it,—</p>

</div>

<p class='c021'>He retired to the classic Tusculum
of his villa in St John’s Wood.
There, cheered by the faithful adherence
of some elegant companions,
who, if they did not believe
him innocent, found him unalterably
agreeable, he sipped his claret
and moralised on his creed. Doubtless
he believed that “the talk would
soon subside,” “the thing blow
over.” The world would miss him
too much not to rally again round
the sage who so justly despised it.
Perhaps his belief might have been
realised, but,</p>

this amiable man-scorner’s social
career, once, and once only, he is
said to have given way to anger.
One of his associates (I say designedly
associates, not friends, out of
respect for his memory, since friendship
is a virtue, and he therefore
denied its existence)—one of his
associates, warmed perhaps into literature
by his own polite acquaintance
with all that is <i><span lang="fr">laide</span></i> in <i><span lang="fr">belles
lettres</span></i>, wrote a comedy. The comedy
was acted. My hero honoured the
performance by appearing in the
author’s box. Leaning forward so
as to be seen of all men, he joined
his hands in well-bred applause of
every abortive joke and grammatical
solecism, till, in a critical part
of the play, there occurred a popular
claptrap—a something said in
praise of virtue and condemnation
of vice. The gallery of course responded
to the claptrap, expressing
noisy satisfaction at the only sentiment
familiar to their comprehension
which they had hitherto heard.

  <h2 class='c002'>SPEDDING’S LIFE OF BACON.<a id='r6'></a><a href='#f6' class='c007'><sup>[6]</sup></a></h2>
</div>

<div class='footnote' id='f6'>
<p class='c008'><a href='#r6'>6</a>. ‘The Letters and the Life of Francis Bacon.’ By James Spedding. Vols. I. &#38; II.
Lord Macaulay’s ‘Essay on Francis Bacon.’</p>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Mr Spedding, in the modest
form of a commentary on the letters
and occasional writings of Lord
Bacon, is now giving us a biography
of that celebrated man, which
bids fair, for a long time to come,
to be our highest authority on the
subject. To place all the facts before
us on which our judgment of
the character of Lord Bacon should
be formed, is his great object; he
deals in few assertions of his own;
he is disposed to let facts speak for
themselves; he guides our opinion
by a full narrative of the events,
and makes few attempts to influence
us by argument or eloquence.
A more satisfactory or trustworthy
book has rarely come before us.</p>

<p class='c009'>We will not say that Mr Spedding’s
narrative is never coloured
by an imagination which has received
its unconscious prompting
from his admiration of Bacon: one
rather amusing instance of this colouring
of the imagination we think
we have detected, and shall have
occasion to notice; but no admiring
biographer of a great man has
more studiously refrained from
thrusting forward his own opinions
or conceptions where the reader is
merely desirous of obtaining a clear
insight into the facts themselves.
Mr Spedding has not yet completed
his task, but he has given us in
these two volumes more materials
of interest than in the space of a
single paper we shall have room to
touch upon, and the main topic
which occupies them is fully discussed
and finally dismissed.</p>

<p class='c009'>That topic is the relation between
Bacon and Essex. Of the
splendid Essay of Lord Macaulay’s,
which is still ringing in the ears of
most English readers, no part was
written with more force, or was
more damaging to the character of
Bacon, than that which treated of
his conduct to the Earl of Essex.
Many who could have forgiven the
peccant Chancellor for being too
ready to accept whatever was offered
to him in the shape of present
or gratuity, could not pardon the
cold-blooded and faithless friend.
Now it is precisely on this subject
that Mr Spedding presents us with
materials for forming a very different
judgment from that which the
eloquent pages of Macaulay had
betrayed us into. Up to the period
when Essex disappears from
the scene, these two volumes give
us their clear guidance. Of that
guidance we very gladly avail ourselves.</p>

<p class='c009'>We would premise that it is not
our purpose, or endeavour, to defend
Bacon at all points—to robe our
Chancellor in spotless ermine;
neither do we think that the result
of renewed investigation is a clear
verdict of “Not Guilty” on all the
charges that have been brought
against him. There is much in
Macaulay’s estimate both of the
character and the philosophy of
Bacon with which we cordially
agree. It happens frequently with
great historic names that there is
an oscillation of public opinion;
the too harsh verdict of one writer,
or one age, is followed by a verdict
as much too lenient. Such oscillation
seems to have lately taken
place with regard to Bacon, and the
disposition is at present to find nothing
blameworthy in him. This
disposition we do not share. We
think that no good is done, but
rather harm, when enthusiasm for
the brilliant achievements of any
man, whether in a career of war, or
statesmanship, or letters, induces
us to shut our eyes to his moral
defects. For in these cases we do
not, and cannot, exactly <em>shut our
eyes</em>: we do something worse; we
try to see that vices are not vices.
We lower our standard, that we
may pass no unfavourable judgment.
It is an ill lesson that
teaches us to forgive the overbearing
despotism of a great soldier or great
minister, or the rascality of a great
wit; to see no injustice in a Napoleon,
and no villany in a Sheridan.
We believe that the censure of
Lord Macaulay is too severe, but it
is censure and not praise which the
character of Bacon provokes. We
all know that the fervid eloquence,
or rather the ardent temperament,
of our more than English Livy, led
him into manifest exaggerations;
but in general, we should say that
his drawing is true to nature, except
that it had this too swelling
outline. His exaggerations were
like those of Michael Angelo, who
drew muscles disproportionately
large, but who never drew a muscle
where none existed. A sterling
good sense presided over the verdicts
of Macaulay—over the yes or
no; but the verdict once determined,
the impassioned orator ran
the risk of falsifying it by the ruthless,
unmitigated energy with which
it was delivered.</p>

<p class='c009'>We should not say of Bacon
either that he was the “greatest”
or the “meanest” of mankind.
But as certainly as he was great in
his intellectual attributes, so certainly
was he <em>not</em> great in his moral
character. Here he lacked elevation.
He could tolerate artifice,
and dissimulation, and gross flattery.
If the crime of Essex justified
him, as we are inclined to think
it did, in breaking entirely with
that nobleman, and treating him as
an enemy to the State, what are we
to say of the strain of advice which
he habitually gives to Essex while
the two are yet in perfect amity?
A mere personal ambition, to be
obtained by the petty arts of the
courtier, is all that he prompts his
friend to aspire after. Win the
Queen—honestly, if possible; but,
at all events, win the Queen! This
is the burden of his counsel. Bacon
was <em>great</em> in his intellectual speculations;
he was <em>mean</em> in the conduct
of life. The antithesis still remains
to us in a modified form. All his
life is a continual suing for place;
and what he obtained by flattery
and subservience, he lost by some
poor cupidity.</p>

<p class='c009'>Bacon was a philosopher from
his youth, but from his youth to
his old age he was also a lover of
social distinctions, and of a sumptuous
mode of life. If he had the
desire to take all human knowledge
for his province, and to extend
his name and his good influence
into future ages, if he desired
to be a reformer even of philosophy
itself, he had also other desires of
a much more commonplace description;
not evil in themselves—good
perhaps in themselves—but not
subordinated to the high morality
which might have been expected
from one so wise. But if in his
rise to power he showed too much
servility—if, when in the seat of
power, he showed too much cupidity,—surely
no one ever fell from
greatness, no one was ever struck
down from the seat of power, for
so slight a measure of criminality.
No historic personage can be mentioned
amongst us, on whom so severe
a punishment, so deep a disgrace,
was inflicted for a fault so
little heinous.</p>

<p class='c009'>The first great error which Bacon
committed, the consequence of
which pursued him all his life, was
<em>the running into debt</em>. It was a
life-long fault. It was his fault,
not his misfortune. He received
less, we know, from his father than
he might reasonably have expected,
less than his brothers had received,
but no biographer has ventured to
call him poor—so poor that he
could not have held his ground as
a student of the law without incurring
debt. Whether it was mere
carelessness and imprudence, or a
wilful spending “according to his
hopes, not his possessions,” we find
him very early in debt; and as years
advance we find the debts, of course,
more and more onerous. No one
knew better than Bacon that he
who owes has to borrow, and that
he who borrows will have, in some
form, to beg, to sue—will be tempted
to sordid actions—will lose his
independence, his upright attitude
amongst men. There is no greater
slavery than debt. It bred in
Bacon that “itching palm,” and
that perpetual suing, which disgrace
his career.</p>

<p class='c009'>He begins to sue from his very
first entry into life. He puts his
trust in the Lord Treasurer. And
what is remarkable, the very nature
of the first suit he makes is unknown.
It was some office, <em>not</em> of
a legal character, as we should conjecture.
Writing to Walsingham
about it, he says that the delay in
answering it “hinders me from
taking a course of practice which,
by the leave of God, if her Majesty
like not of my suit, I must and will
follow: <em>not for any necessity of
estate, but for my credit sake</em>, which
I know by living out of action will
wear.” At this date, 25th August
1585, he does not plead absolute
inability to live on his private fortune.
Subsequently, when his
debts have increased, he writes upon
this subject in a very different
strain. He is embarrassed by
usurers; he is arrested; debt comes
upon him, as he says, like an armed
man.</p>

<p class='c009'>Of the earliest years of Bacon
few memorials remain. But Mr
Spedding brings together two conspicuous
facts. The first is, that
Bacon, at the age of fifteen, conceives
his project of a reformation
in philosophy; and the second is,
that immediately on leaving college
he accompanies Sir Amias Paulet
on his embassy to France. Thus
philosophy and diplomacy, speculation
and state-craft, study and the
world, take at once joint possession
of Francis Bacon.</p>

<p class='c009'>Of the first of these facts, and
the most important in his life, Mr
Spedding speaks in a passage of
much eloquence, glowing and chastened
withal:—</p>

<p class='c010'>“That the thought first occurred to
him during his residence at Cambridge,
therefore before he had completed his
fifteenth year, we know upon the best
authority—his own statement to Dr
Rawley. I believe it ought to be regarded
as the most important event of
his life—the event which had a greater
influence than any other upon his character
and future course. From that
moment there was awakened within his
breast the appetite which cannot be
satiated, and the passion which cannot
commit excess. From that moment he
had a vocation which employed and
stimulated all the energies of his mind,
gave a value to every vacant interval of
time, an interest and significance to
every random thought and casual accession
of knowledge—an object to live for
as wide as humanity, as immortal as the
human race—an idea to live in vast and
lofty enough to fill the soul for ever with
religious and heroic aspirations. From
that moment, though still subject to
interruptions, disappointments, errors,
and regrets, he could never be without
either work or hope or consolation.”</p>

<p class='c008'>But this young philosopher is
son of Sir Nicholas Bacon, the late
Lord Chancellor; the Queen has
laid her hand upon his head while
yet a boy, and called him her young
Lord Keeper; he is nephew to
the Prime Minister; he dreams of
courts, of place, of power. He
must unite his lofty speculations
with the great affairs of State; he
must survey human knowledge from
the high places of society. He
enters Gray’s Inn, is a student of
the law, and his heart aches after
office and promotion.</p>

<p class='c009'>There is one person very intimately
connected with Bacon, whom Mr
Spedding has brought before us
with a novel distinctness—his mother,
Lady Bacon. We are not
aware that her presence will throw
much light on the character of her
son, but henceforth, we are sure,
no biography of the son will be written
in which this lady will not be
a conspicuous figure. She is one of
those strongly-marked characters
that always please the imagination;
dogmatic, perverse, full of maternal
anxiety, pious and splenetic, with
marvellous shrewd sense and a
very ungovernable temper. The
knowledge of her character would
enable us to answer one question.
Presuming that any one should think
fit to ask why Bacon did not seek
the retirement of Gorhambury, the
answer is quite ready. There would
have been no peace for him under
the roof of his lady mother. Puritan
and termagant, his philosophy
would have been “suspect” to her;
and his retirement would have been
certainly denounced as unpardonable
sloth. She is a learned lady,
mingles scraps of Latin and Greek
in her epistles, and she can write,
when the occasion demands, in a
very stately English style—stately,
but straightforward withal. Her
son’s epistolary style is often involved
and verbose. He does not
often come so directly to the point
as Lady Bacon does in the following
letter, written to Lord Burghley,
in the interest of the Nonconformist
clergy, or <em>Preachers</em>, as they
were then called. In a conference
which had lately taken place at
Lambeth between them and the
bishops, she thinks they had not
fair-play; she appeals, in their
name, to her Majesty and the
Council:—</p>

<p class='c010'>“They would most humbly crave,
both of God in heaven, whose cause it
is, and of their Majesty, their most excellent
sovereign here on earth, that
they might obtain quiet and convenient
audience rather before her Majesty herself,
whose heart is in God his hand to
touch and to turn, or before your Honours
of the Council, whose wisdom they
greatly reverence; and if they cannot
strongly prove before you out of the
word of God that reformation which they
so long have called and cried for to be
according to Christ his own ordinance,
then to let them be rejected with shame
out of the Church for ever.... And
therefore, for such weighty conference
they appeal to her Majesty and her honourable
wise Council, whom God has
placed in highest authority for the advancement
of His kingdom; and refuse
the bishops for judges, who are parties
partial in their own defence, because
they seek more worldly ambition than
the glory of Jesus Christ.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Mr Spedding next introduces to
us the same lady under the agitations,
as he says, of maternal
anxiety. Anthony Bacon, the elder
brother of Francis, has been long
upon the Continent collecting intelligence,
and otherwise amusing
or occupying himself. He sends
over one Lawson, a confidential
servant, to Lord Burghley with
some important communication.
Lawson is a Catholic. That her son
Anthony should be so long in Popish
parts is a dire grievance to Lady
Bacon; that he should have in his
confidence a Papist servant, is not
to be borne. She prevails upon
Burghley to have this Lawson
arrested and retained in England.
One snake is, at all events, caught,
and shall be held firm. Anthony
writes to his friend, Francis Allen,
to obtain for him the liberation of
Lawson. Allen, furnished with a
letter from Lord Burghley (who
seems, for his own part, to be willing
to release the man), proceeds to
Gorhambury. His intercession with
Lady Bacon he tells himself in a
letter to Anthony:—</p>

<p class='c010'>“Upon my arrival at Godombery my
lady used me courteously until such time
I began to move her for Mr Lawson,
and, to say the truth, for yourself;—being
so much transported with your abode
there that she let not to say that you
are a traitor to God and your country:
you have undone her; you seek her
death; and when you have that you
seek for, you shall have but a hundred
pounds more than you have now.</p>

<p class='c013'>“She is resolved to procure her Majesty’s
letter to force you to return; and
when that shall be, if her Majesty gave
you your right or desert, she should clap
you up in prison....</p>

<p class='c013'>“I am sorry to write it, considering
his deserts and your love towards him;
but the truth will be known at the last,
and better late than never: it is vain to
look for Mr Lawson’s return, for these
are her ladyship’s own words—‘No, no,’
saith she, ‘I have learned not to employ
ill to good; and if there were no more
men in England, and although you
should never come home, he shall never
come to you.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“It is as unpossible to persuade my
lady to send him, as for myself to send
you Paul’s steeple....</p>

<p class='c013'>“When you have received your provision,
make your repair home again,
lest you be a means to shorten her days,
for she told me the grief of mind received,
daily by your stay will be her end; also
saith her jewels be spent for you, and
that she borrowed the last money of
seven several persons.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Thus much I must confess unto you
for a conclusion, that I have never seen
and never shall see a wise lady, an honourable
woman, a mother more perplexed
for her son’s absence, than I have seen
that honourable dame for yours. Therefore
lay your hand on your heart, look
not for Mr Lawson; here he hath, as a
man may say, heaven and earth against
him and his return.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Soon after this Anthony does
return home, and Lady Bacon addresses
him a letter, in which there
are some allusions to Francis, which
will be read with interest:—</p>

<p class='c010'>“This one chiefest counsel your
Christian and natural mother doth give
you even before the Lord, that above
all worldly respects you carry yourself
ever at your first coming as one that doth
unfeignedly profess the true religion of
Christ, and hath the love of the truth
now, by long continuance, fast settled
in your heart, and that with judgment,
wisdom, and discretion; and are not
afraid or ashamed to testify the same by
hearing and delighting in those religious
exercises of the sincerer sort, be they
French or English. <i><span lang="la">In hoc noli adhibere
fratrem tuum ad consilium aut exemplum</span></i>....</p>

<p class='c013'>“I trust you, with your servants,
use prayer twice in a day, having been
where reformation is. Omit it not for
any. It will be your best credit to serve
the Lord duly and reverently, and you
will be observed at first now. Your
brother is too negligent herein, but do
you well and zealously; it will be looked
for of the best-learned sort, and that is
best.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Full of prudence, full of zeal,
suspecting her sons themselves and
every one about them, anxious to
manage them on all points, whether
in their diet or their religion, such
is Lady Bacon. She is writing still
to Anthony.</p>

<p class='c010'>“<i><span lang="la">Gratia et salus.</span></i> That you increase
in amending I am glad. God continue
it every way. When you cease of your
prescribed diet, you had need, I think,
to be very wary both of your sudden
change of quantity and of season of your
feeding—especially suppers late or full.
Procure rest in convenient time; it helpeth
much to digestion. I verily think your
brother’s weak stomach to digest hath
been much caused and confirmed by untimely
going to bed, and then musing
<i><span lang="la">nescio quid</span></i> when he should sleep, and
then, in consequent, by late rising and
long lying in bed, whereby his men
are made slothful, and himself continueth
sickly. But my sons haste not to
hearken to their mother’s good counsel
in time to prevent. The Lord, our
heavenly Father, heal and bless you both
as His sons in Christ Jesus. I promise
you, touching your coach, if it be so to
your contentation, it was not wisdom to
have it seen or known at the Court; you
shall be so much pressed to lend, and
your man, for gain, so ready to agree, that
the discommodity thereof will be as much
as the commodity. Let not your men
see my letter. I write to you, and not to
them.”</p>

<p class='c008'>And again, a few days later:—</p>

<p class='c010'>“I am glad, and thank God of your
amendment. But my man said he heard
you rose at three of the clock. I thought
that was not well, so suddenly from
bedding much to rise so early—newly
out of your diet.... I like not your
lending your coach yet to my lord and
lady. If you once begin, you shall hardly
end. It was not well it was so soon
sent into the Court to make talk, and
at last be promised and misliked. Tell
your brother I counsel you to send it no
more. What had my Lady Shriefess
to borrow your coach?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Any comment of ours would only
weaken the effect of such graphic
letters as these. We are enabled
even to follow our zealous, dogmatic,
yet motherly woman, into her
own household. Edward Spencer
was a servant of Anthony’s, but was
left for some reason at Gorhambury.
He writes to his master:—</p>

<p class='c010'>“My humble duty remembered to
your good worship. I thought good to
write to you to satisfy you how unquiet
my lady is with all her household.”
[Then he enters into a long story how
my lady had said of a certain “grænen
bitch,” whatever that may be, that it
should be hanged; and how, when Edward
Spencer obeys her command, and
hangs the dog, my lady breaks out into
a “fransey.”]—“My lady do not speak
to me as yet. I will give none offence
to make her angry; but nobody can
please her long together.”</p>

<p class='c008'>And again—</p>

<p class='c010'>“My humble duty first remembered
to your good worship. I thought good to
write unto you to sartey you of my lady’s
great unquietness in the house. Since her
last falling-out with me she showed me
a good countenance as ever she did before.
Now, yesterday I had a sparhawk
given me, and she killed a brace of partridges,
and then I came home before
the evening was shut in; indeed, all the
folks had supped: whereat she seemed to
be very sore angry with these words—‘What
come you home now? I would
you and your hawk would keep you away
altogether. You have been a-breaking
of hedges between neighbour and neighbour,
and now you come home out of
order, and show an ill example in my
house. Well, you shall keep no hawk
here.’ ‘I am the more sorrier I have
given no acause that your ladyship should
be offended, nor I will not. To please
your ladyship I will pull off her head.’
Whereat she stamped and said, I would
do by her as I did by the bitch. Insomuch
she would let me have no supper.
So truly I went to bed without my
supper. There is not one man in the
house but she fall out withal, and is
not in charity one day in a week but
with priests, which will undo her. There
is one Page that had six pounds on her.
Mr Willcocks had a paper with a great
deal of gold in it. Wellblod had two
quarterns of wheat. Dicke had something
the other day; what, I know
not.”</p>

<p class='c008'>There is more of the same kind;
though whether it is quite fair to
take the testimony of this Edward
Spencer without hearing what Lady
Bacon could report of <em>him</em>, is worth
a thought. He must have been a
surly fellow, from his offering so
readily to pull off the hawk’s head.
Our next quotation brings us back
to Francis, and the unhappy subject
of his debts: we have hints,
too, of the influence under which
she suspects these debts to be
incurred, which the modern biographer
is unable to follow out;
and which, from the different manners
of a former age, it is difficult
entirely to understand. But we
are confirmed by these extracts in
our previous convictions, that the
loss which Francis is said to have
sustained by the sudden death of
his father (who thus failed to make
the full provision for him he intended)
cannot be represented as
the real cause of his embarrassments.
Mr Spedding represents
this fact “as perplexing the problem
of his life with a new and inconvenient
addition.” But it could
not have materially perplexed the
problem of his life, unless it disabled
him from living upon his
private fortune. It made him a
poorer gentleman; but if he had
been a richer, he would still have
been a suitor at the Court, and
still, in all probability, have incurred
debts. He and Anthony
live together, and we find them
alternately assisting each other.
There is no evidence of a great
disparity in their fortunes. What
share Francis had in the “coach”
we know not, but we hear of him
purchasing horses; and certainly
the mother does not look upon the
embarrassments of Francis as some
inevitable consequence of his position.
She is applied to, in the
present case, to assist him in the
payment of his debts, by joining in
the sale of an estate which belongs
to him, but in which she has some
legal right. Anthony makes the
request, and receives the following
reply:—</p>

<p class='c010'>“For your brotherly care of your
brother Francis’s estate you are to be
well liked, and so I do as a Christian
mother that loveth you both as the
children of God; but, as I wrote but in
a few words yesterday by my neighbour,
the state of you both doth much disquiet
me, as in Greek words I signified
shortly.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I have been too ready for you both
till nothing is left. And surely, though
I pity your brother, yet so long as he
pitieth not himself, but keepeth that
bloody Percy, as I told him then, yea
as a coach-companion and bed-companion,—a
proud, profane, costly fellow,
whose being about him I verily fear
the Lord God doth mislike, and doth
less bless your brother in credit and
otherwise in his health,—surely I am
utterly discouraged, and make a conscience
further to undo myself to maintain
such wretches as he is. This Jones (?)
never loved your brother, indeed, but
for his own credit, being upon your
brother, and thankless, though bragging.
But your brother will be blind
to his own hurt.... It is most
certain till first Enney (?), a filthy,
wasteful knave, and his Welshman, one
after another—for take one, and they
will still swarm ill-favouredly—did so
lead him, as in a train; he was a towardly
young gentleman, and a son of much
good hope in goodliness. But seeing
that he hath nourished most sinful proud
villains wilfully, I know not what other
answer to make.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Then, partly relenting, she adds
in a postscript:—</p>

<p class='c010'>“If your brother desire a release to
Mr Harvey, let him so require it himself,
and but upon this condition, by his
own hand and bond, I will not; that is,
that he make and give me a true note of
all his debts, and leave to me the whole
order and receipt of all his money for his
land, to Harvey, and the just payment of
all his debts thereby. And, by the mercy
and grace of God, it shall be performed
by me to his quiet discharge, without
cumbering him, and to his credit. For I
will not have his cormorant seducers,
and instruments of Satan to him, committing
foul sin by his countenance to
the displeasing of God and his godly true
fear. Otherwise I will not, <i><span lang="it">pro certo</span></i>.”</p>

<p class='c008'>This was a condition which, as
Mr Spedding observes, was hard
of digestion for an expectant Attorney-General.
It was not complied
with. But we need not attempt to
follow these obscure transactions
further; and here we may part
company with Lady Bacon. In
justice to her let it be added that,
if she scolded her son Francis, she
could assert his claims boldly before
others. In a reported conversation
with Sir Robert Cecil she
does not scruple to hint that he is
but ill used by his powerful relatives.
She little understands what
manner of son she has; she says
truly that he is thinking <i><span lang="la">nescio
quid</span></i>, but she is not without a certain
degree of motherly pride, as
well as motherly tenderness, for
him.</p>

<p class='c009'>We must now turn to that portion
of Bacon’s history in which we
see him brought into relationship
with Essex. Mr Spedding has represented
the friendship of the two
men as being based on very noble
motives. Essex was no doubt attracted
to Bacon, in the first instance,
by a generous admiration
for his talents. But we do not
find that on Bacon’s side there was
any reciprocal ardour. We cannot
help thinking that what Bacon chiefly
saw in Essex was the young nobleman
likely to be the great favourite
of Elizabeth. Bacon, we are told by
Mr Spedding, saw in Essex a man
capable of “entering heartily into
all his largest speculations for the
good of the world, and placed by
accident in a position to realise, or
help to realise them. It was natural
to hope that he could do it.”—(Vol.
i. p. 106.) We have a portrait
of Essex, as he first appeared
to Bacon, drawn in glowing colours.
This young nobleman is not
only described as being (what all
have admitted) generous, brave,
and ardent in his friendship, but
credit is given him for wide contemplative
ends, or, at least, an
aptitude is presumed in him for
purely patriotic or philanthropic
purposes. Now, from the commencement
to the termination of
his career, all his good qualities
are seen in the service of a mere
flagrant personal ambition. He is
jealous of every honour bestowed
upon another: he must be first
in the country. And so far from
detecting any great plan or noble
intention in the use of power, we
see him, still at an early age, prepared
to throw the whole nation
into confusion in order to obtain
place or power for himself. And
as to Bacon, throughout the whole
of his correspondence with Essex
there are no traces of anything
higher than prudential and sometimes
crafty counsels, how best to
obtain favour and advancement at
Court. The relationship between
them is chiefly this, that Essex is
to obtain office and promotion for
Bacon, and Bacon by his aid and
advice is to administer to the greatness
of Essex. The relationship
has nothing in it peculiarly reprehensible,
but nothing certainly of
an elevating character. Sometimes
the strain of advice which the philosopher
gives is of a quite ignoble
character, counselling, as it does, a
tricky, dissimulating conduct. It
is no Utopia of any kind, moral or
scientific, that he has in view for
Essex, or for himself as connected
with Essex. It is how to rise at
Court that he studies for his friend,
and it is the petty arts of the courtier
that he sometimes condescends to
teach.</p>

<p class='c009'>We will content ourselves with
one quotation: it must be a rather
long one, because a single sentence
wrung from its context may give no
fair impression of the general strain
of a letter of advice. The following
was written to Essex soon after his
famous expedition to Cadiz:—</p>

<p class='c010'>“I said to your Lordship last time,
<i><span lang="la">Martha, Martha, attendis ad plurima,
unum sufficit</span></i>; win the Queen: if this be
not the beginning, of any other course I
see no end....</p>

<p class='c013'>“For the removing the impression of
your nature to be <i><span lang="fr">opiniastre</span></i>, and not rulable:
First, and above all things, I wish
that all matters past, which cannot be
revoked, your Lordship would turn altogether
upon insatisfaction, and not
upon your nature or proper disposition.
This string you cannot upon every apt
occasion harp upon too much. Next,
whereas I have noted you to fly and
avoid (in some respect justly) the resemblance
or imitation of my Lord of Leicester
and my Lord Chancellor Hatton;
yet I am persuaded (howsoever I wish
your Lordship as distant as you are from
them in points of favour, integrity, magnanimity,
and merit) that it will do
you much good, between the Queen and
you, to allege them (as oft as you find
occasion) for authors and patterns. For
I do not know a readier mean to make her
Majesty think you are in your right way.
Thirdly, when at any time your Lordship
upon occasion happen in speeches
to do her Majesty right (for there is no
such matter as flattery amongst you all),
I fear you handle it <i><span lang="la">magis in speciem
adornatis verbis quam ut sentire videaris</span></i>,
so that a man may read formality in
your countenance; whereas your Lordship
should do it familiarly <i><span lang="la">et oratione
fidâ</span></i>. Fourthly, your Lordship should
never be without some particulars of art,
<em>which you should seem to pursue with
earnestness and affection, and then let
them fall upon taking knowledge of her
Majesty’s opposition and dislike</em>. Of
which the weightiest sort may be, if your
Lordship offers to labour in the behalf
of some that you favour for some of the
places that are void, choosing such a subject
as you think her Majesty is likely to
oppose unto. And if you will say that
this is <i><span lang="la">conjunctum cum alienâ injurâ</span></i>, I
will not answer, <i><span lang="la">Hæc non aliter constabunt</span></i>;
but I say commendation from so
good a mouth doth not hurt a man,
though you prevail not. A less weighty
sort of particulars may be the pretence
of some journeys, which at her Majesty’s
request your Lordship mought relinquish;
or if you would pretend a journey
to see your living and estate towards
Wales, or the like; for as for great foreign
journeys of employment and service, it
standeth not with your gravity to play
or stratagem with them. And the lightest
sort of particulars, which yet are not
to be neglected, are in your habits, apparel,
wearings, gestures, and the like....</p>

<p class='c013'>“The third impression is of a popular
reputation; which, because it is a thing
good in itself, being obtained as your
Lordship obtaineth it, that is <i><span lang="la">bonis artibus</span></i>;
and besides well governed, is one of
the best flowers of your greatness, both
present and to come; it would be handled
tenderly. The only way is to quench
it <i><span lang="la">verbis</span></i>, but not <em>rebus</em>. And, therefore,
<em>to take all occasions to the Queen to speak
against popularity and popular courses
vehemently, and to tax it on all others;
but nevertheless to go in your honourable
commonwealth courses as you do</em>. And,
therefore, I will not advise you to cure
this by dealing in monopolies or any
oppressions. Only, if in Parliament
your Lordship be forward for treasure in
respect of the wars, it becometh your person
well; and if her Majesty object popularity
to you at any time, I would say
to her, A Parliament will show that; and
so feed her with expectation.”</p>

<p class='c008'>It is only the fear of being tedious
that prevents us from giving
other passages in which Bacon
counsels dissimulation and these
petty artifices of the courtier. We
do not say that passages like this
deserve any violent reprobation,
but we do say that the writer of
them must have a very lax morality
on the subject of truth-speaking;
he <em>must</em> be deficient in self-respect,
in moral dignity. Such a counsellor
would not improve <em>the man</em> who
followed his advice, however he
might improve his <em>fortunes</em>. There
was a love of manœuvring, of petty
diplomacy, in Bacon. In one place
we find him framing two fictitious
letters, the one pretending to be
written by his brother Anthony,
and the other by the Earl of Essex.
This fictitious correspondence was
to be shown to the Queen.—(Vol.
ii. p. 197.)</p>

<p class='c009'>In Bacon, we may observe, we
have not the mere ordinary contrast
between good teaching and bad
practice. We have not a Seneca
professing a stoical morality and
writing apologies for Nero (or any
instance of this kind which the
reader may choose for himself, for
Seneca may have his defenders, and
many are disposed at present to say
a good word in favour of Nero).
It is not a contrast of this kind we
have chiefly to remark in Bacon:
what we notice is a defect in the
cultivation of the moral sentiments.
The force of his intellect had gone
out in another direction. He had
great aspirations for the good of
mankind; but these aspirations
were connected with his theory of
knowledge, and they were aspirations
after increased power, and
“commodity,” and the physical
wellbeing of man. It was not his
habit to dwell much upon those
moral sentiments which make, in
all ages, the elevation of the individual
mind.</p>

<p class='c009'>But the grave and specific charge
brought against Bacon is that of
ingratitude to his friend. We have
to ask what was the amount or kind
of obligation under which Bacon
had been placed? What was the
friendship he was supposed to have
sacrificed to his interest? And
whether the criminal conduct of
Essex did not manumit him from
all the bonds of friendship, whatever
they might have been? Though
not always a high-minded counsellor,
Bacon was the last man in the
country to tolerate an open act of
rebellion against the Queen and the
established Government. The evidence,
as laid before us by Mr
Spedding, proves beyond a doubt
the grave criminality of Essex. If
we have a friend who passes with
us as an honest man, and he suddenly
proves a villain, we generally
fling our friendship to the winds—we
disclaim and renounce the man
who, in addition to his other villanies,
has practised a treachery
upon ourselves. In fact, the condemnation
of Essex may be said to
be here the acquittal of Bacon.</p>

<p class='c009'>We shall not haggle about the
amount of specific service rendered
by Essex to his friend. Every
generous mind feels gratitude according
to the generosity of purpose
of the donor. Essex, in the ardour
of his youth, was, as we have said,
drawn towards Bacon by admiration
of his great intellect, and was only
too zealous to promote his interest.
His zeal outran his discretion. Nothing
came of it but disappointment
to both parties. But this would
not have extinguished a grateful
feeling.</p>

<p class='c009'>We have no ground whatever for
supposing that the intercession of
Essex really <em>prevented</em> Bacon from
obtaining first the Attorney-Generalship,
and, subsequently, the
Solicitor-Generalship. That nobleman
speaks of his solicitations doing
more harm than good; but an expression
of this kind was either a
generous depreciation of his own
services, or the result of a moody
anger against the Queen whom he
had failed to move. It does not
seem that Bacon at this time had
any chance at Court. The Queen
was in no hurry to promote him.
He had obtained no practice at the
bar, and it is no want of charity to
attribute this in Bacon to an unwillingness
to spend his strength
and powers on the ordinary routine
of legal business. But this unwillingness
must have operated against
him. The very qualities for which
we now admire Bacon must have
disparaged him as a man of business
in the eyes of Queen Elizabeth
and Lord Burghley. A man who
has long ago left his college, and
who is still dreaming about reforms
in philosophy, and who tells the
Lord Treasurer himself that “he
has as vast contemplative ends as
he has moderate civil ends,” does
not seem exactly the person for an
Attorney-General. Bacon, at all
events, does not scruple, on a subsequent
occasion, to have recourse
again to his friend’s intercession.
When Egerton became Lord Keeper,
Bacon wished to succeed him as
Master of the Rolls, and he requests
Essex to write to Egerton in his
favour. He makes this request (we
may observe in passing) in a diplomatic
manner; he writing half the
matter in his own letter, and Anthony
being more explicit in a letter
he sends at the same time. It is
impossible not to remark that Bacon
is grasping at the higher prizes of
the profession before he has endured
the heat and burden of a
lawyer’s life.</p>

<p class='c009'>His friend Essex being unable
to procure for him either the Attorney-Generalship
or the Solicitor-Generalship,
and feeling indebted
for many services, gave him a small
estate, worth, we are told, £1800 in
the currency of these times. This
was a gift which, in one sense of
the word, Bacon may be said to
have earned; but, if we may judge
according to the present state of
feeling on these matters, it was a
gift which he could not have felt
perfectly satisfied in accepting.
Nothing but his debts, we venture
to assert, persuaded him to accept
it. The services he had rendered
were not such as are paid by money—they
were never rendered for
money-payment. It would be a very
coarse interpretation (and one which
Mr Spedding has avoided) to call
this gift a <em>fee</em> for advice and assistance
tendered to the Earl. It was
not professional advice that he
gave, whether he taught him how
to rise at Court, or assisted him
in the duties of a privy councillor.
There was an interchange of good
offices between the two men; but
Bacon sinks from his rightful equality
if he accepts money as an equivalent
for any <em>balance</em> of such good
offices as might be in his favour.
Mr Spedding suggests that the aid
which Bacon rendered in certain
masques or devices got up for the
entertainment of the Queen must
be included in the list of his services;
but Mr Spedding would not
certainly have counselled him to
hold out his hand for a money-payment
for what was doubtless entered
into in the spirit of a literary amusement.
If, indeed, the two speeches
which are given us here on Knowledge
and in Praise of the Queen
were really delivered at these devices,
Bacon must have made these
entertainments subservient to certain
graver purposes of his own.
We should like to know if the audience
felt thankful to the author for
his eloquent but very long orations.</p>

<p class='c009'>So stands the account against
Bacon, and the two men are still
friends, when one of them suddenly
appears in the new character of
traitor and rebel. We say <em>suddenly</em>,
for, though Essex had been long
plotting some surprise upon the
Government—some insurrectionary
movement—some advantage to be
taken either of his military power
or his popularity with the mob—yet
he had so far learnt one lesson
of his friend, the lesson of dissimulation,
that he had been able to
conceal from him these secret purposes.
Even so far back as when
he was organising his great expedition
to Ireland, which was to crush
the rebellion of Tyrone, he is suspected
of some intention of using
the forces that were put under his
command <em>against</em> the Queen’s Government.
We are certainly driven
to this alternative: <em>either</em> the Earl
on that expedition manifested such
incapacity as is unparalleled even
in those days of brave knights and
incompetent generals; <em>or</em> he acted
throughout in the spirit of a traitor.
He has the command of an army,
large for those days, of 16,000 men;
he does absolutely nothing with it—fritters
it away; comes up at
length to Tyrone with some 4000
men, Tyrone greatly outnumbering
him. He draws up his forces on a
hill; Tyrone refuses to charge uphill,
but invites Essex to a parley.
Essex accepts the invitation; has
half an hour’s talk with the rebel,
who gives him <em>verbally</em> the terms
on which he is willing to lay down
his arms—terms which are those of
a conqueror. Essex promises to
carry these terms to the Queen,
concludes a truce, and there the
campaign ends. The sum total, as
Mr Spedding says, would stand
thus:—Expended, £300,000 and
ten or twelve thousand men; Received
a suspension of hostilities
for six weeks, with promise of a
fortnight’s notice before recommencing
them, and a verbal communication
of the conditions on
which he was willing to make peace.</p>

<p class='c009'>Essex hastens back to England
to make his own peace with the
Queen. She at first receives him
amicably; but reasons of State
overweigh her personal amity; some
inquiry must be made into the disastrous
expedition; he is commanded
to keep his own chamber. This
takes place at Nonsuch.</p>

<p class='c009'>At this juncture Bacon writes
the following letter. It proves, as
Mr Spedding observes, that Bacon
could have had no suspicion of any
treasonable scheme on the part of
Essex; but we cannot help remarking
the tone of <em>hollowness</em> in the
letter, and especially in that <em>congratulatory</em>
sentence, which cannot
fail to strike the reader. He
knew enough of the expedition to
Ireland to know that, from whatever
cause, it was an utter failure.</p>

<p class='c010'>“My Lord,—Conceiving that your
Lordship comes now up in the person of
a good servant to serve your sovereign
mistress, which kind of compliments we
many times <i><span lang="la">instar magnorum meritorum</span></i>,
and therefore it would be hard for me to
find you, I have committed to this poor
paper the humble salutations of him
that is more yours than any man’s, and
more yours than any man. To these
salutations I add a due and joyful gratulation,
confessing that your Lordship in
your last conference with me, before your
journey, spake not in vain, God making
it good, that you trusted we should say
<i><span lang="la">Quis putasset</span></i>, which, as it is found true
in a happy sense, or I wish you do not
find another <i><span lang="la">Quis putasset</span></i> in <em>the manner
of taking this so great a service</em>. But I
hope it is, as he said, <i><span lang="la">Nubecula est, cito
transibit</span></i>: and that your Lordship’s wisdom
and obsequious circumspection and
patience will turn all to the best. So
referring all to some time that I may
attend you, I commit you to God’s best
preservations.”</p>

<p class='c008'>We do not believe that Bacon
was capable of an ardent friendship
for any one; he was urbane and
courteous to all, as is the manner
with men of thought and equanimity.
With regard to Essex, this
letter alone would be sufficient
proof to us that he had all along
been more of the courtier than the
friend. No friend, in these circumstances,
<em>could</em> have written in this
hollow strain of congratulation.</p>

<p class='c009'>In a short time, however, this
strain alters. Essex is examined
before the Council, and is committed
to the custody of the Lord Keeper.
He remains in privacy at York
House. The <i><span lang="la">nubecula</span></i> is growing
into a very dark cloud. Bacon, in
his interviews with the Queen,
does all that a cautious man can
do to bring about a reconciliation.
But if a reconciliation is impossible,
he must serve his sovereign, and
not Essex. He now writes thus:—</p>

<p class='c010'>“My Lord,—No man can better expound
my doings than your Lordship,
which maketh me need to say the less.
Only I humbly pray you to believe that
I aspire to the conscience and commendation
first of <i><span lang="la">bonus civis</span></i>, which with us
is a good and true servant to the Queen;
and next of <i><span lang="la">bonus vir</span></i>, that is an honest
man. I desire your Lordship also to
think that although I confess I love
some things much better than I love
your Lordship, as the Queen’s service,
her quiet and contentment, her honour,
her favour, the good of my country, and
the like, yet I love few persons better
than yourself, both for gratitude’s sake
and your own virtues, which cannot hurt
but by accident and abuse. Of which my
good affections I was ever and am ready
to yield testimony by any good offices,
but with such reservations as yourself
cannot but allow; for as I was ever sorry
that your Lordship should fly with
waxen wings, doubting Icarus’s fortune,
so for the growing up of your own
feathers, specially ostrich’s, or any other
save of a bird of prey, no man shall be
more glad.”</p>

<p class='c008'>To which letter Essex returned
a dignified answer, such as a man
might have written who intended
to retire from an unjust world into
contemplative life.</p>

<p class='c009'>Soon after this correspondence
Essex was released from even the
gentle confinement in which he
had been held. He could have retired,
with none to molest him,
into contemplative life. His private
fortune was untouched; his name
was still popular with the multitude.
Perhaps, after a short interval
of retirement patiently endured,
he might have returned to
Court, and have been reinstated in
all his honour and offices.</p>

<p class='c009'>The truth was that he had been
for some time past tampering with
treason of the boldest and most
criminal description. Before leaving
Ireland he held a consultation
with his friends Blount and Southampton,
and told them “that he
found it necessary for him to go to
England, and thought it fit to carry
with him as much of the army as
he could conveniently transport, to
go on shore with him to Wales, and
there to make good his landing till
he could send for more; not doubting
but his army would so increase
in a small time that he should be
able to march to London and make
his conditions as he desired.” The
evidence for this treasonable scheme
is stated by Mr Spedding, vol. ii.
p. 147.</p>

<p class='c009'>The time had passed for this
“monstrous” project, as Mr Spedding
justly calls it. But the scheme
into which he now enters is still
more monstrous; it is still more irrational,
and, but for evidence of
an unusually clear and stringent
character, would be utterly incredible.
That scheme was to force
himself upon the Queen, and by an
insurrectionary movement to be carried,
in some way, to the highest
position a subject could hold—perhaps
to some still higher position.
What was to be his pretence?
what the <em>cry</em> by which he was to
rouse the multitude? The succession
to the English throne of James
of Scotland had not been formally
declared, and the <em>cry</em> was to be that
the ministers were plotting to sell
the crown of England to the Infanta!!
It was too absurd, one would
say, even for a mob zealous for the
Protestant succession. Some overtures,
or solicitations for aid, were
made to James, but of what nature
we know not. While the Protestants
were to be alarmed, the Catholics
were to be propitiated by promises
of toleration. But Blount
and other Catholics who entered
into the plot were, no doubt, induced
to do so by stronger motives
than mere promises of toleration—by
those vague expectations and
hopes which a season of anarchy
and confusion and civil war would
open to a party who still amounted
to a large minority of the nation.
“By the end of January 1601,” to
adopt the statement of Mr Spedding,
“all their intrigues and secret
consultations had ripened into a
deliberate and deep-laid plan for
surprising the Court, mastering the
guard, and seizing the Queen’s person,
and so forcing her to dismiss
from her counsels Cecil, Raleigh,
Cobham, and others, and to make
such changes in the State as the conspirators
thought fit.” The several
confessions of those engaged in the
plot, and of Essex himself, leave no
doubt whatever of the fact. How
such a plot is to be rationally explained
is still a perplexity. Sir
Christopher Blount, with a company
of armed men, was to take the
Court gate; Sir John Davis was to
master the hall and go up into the
Great Chamber, where already some
of the conspirators would have
straggled in and seized upon the
halberts of the guard, which usually
stood piled up against the wall;
Sir Charles Davers was to have
taken possession of the Presence;
whereupon Essex, with the Earls of
Southampton, Rutland, and other
noblemen, would have gone in to
the Queen; they would have used
her authority for calling a Parliament,
condemned all whom they denounced
as misgoverning the State,
and made, it is added, changes in
the government. If such a plot had
succeeded, what else could have ensued
than to set loose all the several
parties, sects, and factions of
which the country was composed,
to struggle anew for the supremacy?</p>

<p class='c009'>Meanwhile, some rumours of what
was in preparation reached the
Court; Essex was summoned to the
Council; he excused himself on the
plea of ill health. The conspirators
were alarmed; it seemed to them
that their plot was detected. It
was not yet matured—the hour of
action had not yet come. Still, it
appeared to them that something
must be done. His friends were
assembled. To surprise the Court
was impossible, if the Court was
already on its guard. But the city
might be raised; an insurrectionary
movement might be excited if
Essex, still an idol of the populace,
went among the citizens proclaiming
that his life was in danger from
the machinations of his enemies.
While this expedient was being debated
there arrived from the Court
the Lord Keeper, with three other
lords, sent from the Queen to know
the meaning of this unusual assemblage,
and to demand its dismissal.
Essex was invited to explain to
them the cause of his present discontent.
Their coming still further
precipitated the action. Essex
locked up the four noblemen in
his library, and set off himself, accompanied
with some two hundred
gentlemen, to rouse the city to arms.
But for the inopportune appearance
of these noblemen, Essex and his
friends would have proceeded in
stately fashion on horseback to St
Paul’s Cross; they would have arrived
before the sermon was over
(it was Sunday), and would have
explained their case to the assembled
people. Essex was not deficient
as an orator, and he could,
at all events, have obtained a
solemn hearing. But the visit of
the councillors spoilt even the execution
of the after-plot. The party
went on foot; Essex had no opportunity
to address the people; he
could only cry out as he passed
along that his life was in danger.
A nobleman running along the
streets on a Sunday morning, followed
by two hundred gentlemen
with drawn swords, and exclaiming
that his life was in danger, must
have been a curious spectacle for
the citizens of London. But it
must have been as unintelligible
as it was curious. No one joined
him. The Queen’s troops were collected
to oppose him. He made
his way back to Essex House, where
he was captured, and conveyed to
prison.</p>

<p class='c009'>Up to this time Bacon’s conduct
towards Essex lies open to no peculiar
censure. We have said that he
does not appear to us in the light
of a very wise counsellor, or a very
warm friend; but, as regards Essex,
no specific charge of ingratitude
can be brought against him. It is
after this abortive and miserable
attempt at rebellion that his conduct
to his former friend changes.
And well, we think, it might. Of
the character and designs of Essex
there could be now no doubt whatever.
He has thrown off all disguise.
He stands there an enemy
to the commonwealth. Nothing
but the extreme absurdity of his
conduct hides from us its extreme
criminality.</p>

<p class='c009'>The defence which Essex was at
first prepared to make was simply
the repetition of the false clamour
that he had raised when he rushed
into the city—that his life was in
danger, and that he acted according
to the law of self-preservation. But,
before the trial came on, several of
his associates had made full confession
of the actual plot that had long
been in agitation, and which, only
at the last moment, had been substituted
by this open and clamorous
appeal to the citizens of London.
To Bacon, as one of her Majesty’s
counsel, engaged, as we should say,
for the prosecution, the real state
of the case was known; the
full extent of Essex’s criminality
was known. Do we wonder that,
at this moment, he altogether severed
himself from Essex, and took
his position as a zealous supporter
of the Queen’s government?</p>

<p class='c009'>Lord Macaulay, who could not
have had before him the materials
for forming a judgment which Mr
Spedding has now placed within
the reach of us all, wrote of Essex
and Bacon in the following strain:—“The
person on whom, during
the decline of his influence, he
chiefly depended, to whom he confided
his perplexities, whose advice
he solicited, whose intercession he
employed, was his friend Bacon.
The lamentable truth must be told.
This friend, so loved, so trusted,
bore a principal part in ruining the
Earl’s fortunes, in shedding his
blood, and in blackening his memory.”
A more unfortunate sentence,
or one more replete with
error, was never penned. It would
be ungenerous to revive it in presence
of the lucid statement of facts
which Mr Spedding has given us, if
it were not the case that many are
still under the impressions derived
from this eloquent essay. Essex,
as we have seen, was very far from
confiding his perplexities to Bacon,
or soliciting his advice in those latter
days of his life; and Bacon was
so far from being instrumental to
his ruin, that no advocacy on earth
could have saved him. Nor can it
be said that he blackened the memory
of Essex, for neither on the
trial, nor in the narrative which he
subsequently drew up of the whole
transaction, is the guilt of Essex
overcharged. Nay, with the materials
before us, the historian could
add some very dark strokes to the
picture; for he could show that,
even at a time when Essex was receiving
nothing but favours from
the Court, he was meditating treason;
and he could add that, in his
last moments, he tarnished even his
character for generosity by needlessly
including others, hitherto
unsuspected, in his guilt.</p>

<p class='c009'>What could have been, we are
tempted to ask, the hopes of Essex,
or what his final purpose in this
act of rebellion? Where could he
have stopped? how found safety
for himself in any measure short of
a deposition of the Queen? He
must have known that if, by overpowering
her guard and putting a
personal constraint upon her, he
obliged the Queen to reinstate him
in his former command, yet that the
moment such force was withdrawn
he would have been dismissed again,
and exposed to the resentment of
a proud and injured sovereign. A
subject who goes so far must go
farther still. Elizabeth must have
been deposed, and James prematurely
thrust into her place. It
has been even suggested that Essex
had some wild dream of filling the
throne himself. He was to play
Bolingbroke, and Elizabeth Richard
II.</p>

<p class='c009'>Those who take a lenient view
of Essex’s character might shape a
defence for him out of his very self-will
and the headstrong nature of
the man. They would say he did
not calculate consequences. He
had twice before regained the favour
of the Queen by manifestation
of his own violent and haughty
temper. He had managed the
Queen by proving that he was as
self-willed as herself. He merely
intended to follow the same course
again—to threaten, and display his
power. Such a defence we should
not be unwilling ourselves to adopt,
if the treasonable projects of Essex
had sprung directly, and only, out
of his last dismissal from Court and
his employments. We can conceive
that a spoilt and violent nobleman
might have imagined that he could
successfully overawe the Queen: she
had, indeed, treated him as a spoilt
child, and had something of a maternal
weakness for him: he might
have thought that he could subdue
her spirit by this display of his
power, and yet not have contemplated
any more atrocious act of
rebellion. But the ugly fact remains
that he was meditating high
treason of the most criminal description
before he had been dismissed,
and while he was still the most
favoured subject of her Majesty.</p>

<p class='c009'>Even to those who knew nothing
of his antecedent schemes, it must
have seemed a monstrous thing
that a nobleman, because he has
been dismissed from his command,
should think of reinstating himself
by an armed attack upon the palace,
and a violent seizure of the person
of the Queen. So much as this was
known to Bacon, and was indisputably
proved by the evidence submitted
to him. But why, it will
be said, did Bacon appear upon the
trial at all? If his services were
necessary to the support of the
Queen’s government, he ought to
have given them, whatever his
friendship to Essex; but there
were others who could have performed
his part; he might have
stepped aside; he, in silence, might
have let justice take its course.
“This man is guilty, but he was
my friend; let others pursue him
to his merited punishment.” He
might have said this; <em>we wish he
had</em>. It would have been a graceful
part to play; it would have
added a very pleasing trait to the
biography of Bacon.</p>

<p class='c009'>But such moral enthusiasm had no
place in Bacon’s personal character.
To retire from the post which his
legal functions assigned to him,
might have been seriously prejudicial
to his own interests, and in
the spirit of martyrdom Bacon did
not share in the least degree.
Meanwhile Essex by his conduct
had forfeited the friendship henceforth
of all honest men. It must
be said that Bacon rather lost the
opportunity of doing a gracious
act, than that, in performing his
duties as counsel to the Queen, he
did anything gravely reprehensible.
And he performed these duties
fairly. It is objected against
Bacon that he pressed heavily on
the memory of Essex in the account
he subsequently drew up of the
events. This charge Mr Spedding
has quite dispelled. He shows
that that account is fully justified
by the evidence. The fact is, that
for a long time after his death a
current of popular opinion ran in
favour of the Earl; and the “Declaration,”
therefore, which Bacon,
with the assistance and under the
direction of the Council, drew up,
was regarded as a libel upon his
memory. People refused to believe
him guilty. If any remains of this
partiality to the Earl has descended
to our times, it will be finally dissipated
by Mr Spedding’s work.</p>

<p class='c009'>There is one specific accusation
which Mr Jardine brought against
Bacon, which is here very completely
refuted. Mr Jardine, in examining
the original depositions from which
this “Declaration” was drawn up,
found paragraphs marked along the
margin with a significant <em>om.</em> against
them. He further found that these
passages had been <em>omitted</em> in the
“Declaration,” and he concluded
that this <em>om.</em> was in the handwriting
of Bacon, who had marked these
passages for omission <em>because they
told in favour of Essex</em>. Mr Spedding
replies:—</p>

<p class='c010'>“First, it is by no means certain that
the marks in question were made with
reference to the Declaration at all.
Secondly, it is quite possible that the
passages in question had been omitted at
the trial. Thirdly, whether the omission
were right or wrong, there is no ground
for imputing it to Bacon personally.
Fourthly, the passages omitted do not
in any one particular tend to soften the
evidence against Essex as explained in
the narrative part, or to modify in any
way the history of the case, as far as it
concerned him.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The last, the Fourthly, is quite
sufficient to demolish Mr Jardine’s
hypothesis. These passages appear
to have been omitted because they
affected living persons whom the
Council wished to spare, or because
they contained matters which the
Council did not wish to publish to
all the enemies of the Queen’s Government
at home or abroad. Mr
Spedding, however, has enabled
the reader to judge for himself by
publishing these omitted passages.</p>

<p class='c009'>As very much stress has been
laid on the presumed unfairness of
this Declaration composed by Bacon,
it must be remembered, under the
supervision of the Council, we quote
at length Mr Spedding’s concluding
observations upon it:—</p>

<p class='c010'>“With regard to the general charge
of untruthfulness, I have said that nobody
has yet attempted to specify any
particular untruth expressed or implied
in the Government Declaration. And it
is singular that Mr Jardine himself does
not form an exception; for though he
does specify, as contradicted by one of
the omitted passages, a particular statement
which he <em>assumes</em> to be contained
in the Declaration, it is certain that
there is no such statement there; but
that, on the contrary, the precise import
of that passage, as Mr Jardine himself
infers it, is represented in the body of
the narrative with delicate exactness.
In the absence of such specification, I
can only oppose to the general charge a
general expression of my own conviction;
which is, that the narrative put forth by
the Government was meant to be, and
was by its authors believed to be, a narrative
strictly and scrupulously veracious.
It is true that it was written
under the excitement and agitation of
that last and most portentous disclosure,
which, in proving that Essex had been
capable of designs far worse than anybody
had suspected him of, suggested a
new explanation of all that had been
most suspicious and mysterious in his
previous proceedings; and it may be that
things which before had been rejected as
incredible were now too easily believed.
In so dark a thing as treason it is impossible
to have positive evidence at
every step. Many passages must remain
obscure, and fairly open to more interpretations
than one; and in one or two
of those points which are and profess to
be ‘matter of inference or presumption,’
as distinguished from ‘matter of plain
and direct proof,’ there is room, probably,
without setting aside such indisputable
facts, for an interpretation of Essex’s conduct
more favourable than that adopted
by the Queen and her councillors....
In my own account of the matter I have
abstained, in deference to so general a
prejudice, from using the Declaration as
an authority; and have assumed as a
fact nothing for which I cannot quote
evidence independent of it. For the
rest, I shall let it speak for itself. It
will be found to be a very luminous and
coherent narrative, and certainly much
nearer the truth than any which has
been put forth since it became the fashion
to treat it as a fiction.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Having elected to serve the
Queen, and not his former friend
(and he probably never hesitated
a moment on this subject; he probably
would have thought it mere
idle romance to sacrifice the actual
life and duties before him to the
memory of a dead friendship)—having
elected to serve the Queen,
we do not find that in assisting to
conduct the prosecution Bacon behaved
with undue harshness towards
the accused. The allusion to the
Duke of Guise, which Macaulay
blames so severely, appears to be
one very natural to arise to a
speaker on such an occasion. Essex
did intend, like the Duke of
Guise, to overawe his sovereign.
In one respect the parallel pays an
undeserved compliment to Essex.
The Duke of Guise had the support
of a great party—the zealous Catholics;
if Essex could have attained
the like support from the zealous
Protestants, the Puritans, his scheme
might, at least, have worn a more
rational aspect. Perhaps he fondly
conceived that the Puritans would
adopt him as their representative.
He thought himself a very good
Puritan. This bad citizen was highly
indignant when Coke cast a slur
upon his religion.</p>

<p class='c009'>Here we lose for the present the
guidance of Mr Spedding. We
wait with interest for such disclosures
as he may make for us in the
great charge that burdens the
memory of Bacon—that of judicial
corruption. There are, indeed, two
or three broad facts which, we apprehend,
no historical investigation
can materially alter, and which, we
think, enable us to come to a safe
conclusion in this subject. But
still there is much we should like
to have cleared up to us; especially
we should like to know what had
been the custom of previous Chancellors
in this matter of the reception
of presents. Could, for instance,
the same charges which were
brought against Bacon have been
brought against the father, Sir
Nicholas Bacon?</p>

<p class='c009'>The two or three broad facts we
allude to are these: 1. After a considerable
interval Parliament had
met, and “grievances had been gone
into.” Monopolies were first attacked,
and their attention was called
to certain corrupt practices in the
Court of Chancery. Bacon was
impeached before the House of
Lords. 2. The Lord Chancellor no
longer stood in an amiable footing
with the favourite, the Duke of
Buckingham, who was very willing
to have the Great Seal to bestow on
some other client. The impeached
Chancellor was not likely to receive
any assistance from the Court. The
King advised Bacon to throw himself
on his royal mercy. 3. Under
these circumstances Bacon <em>did</em>
plead guilty, and threw himself on
the mercy of the King; who certainly
fulfilled his part of the compact
by remitting all that he possibly
could of the sentence passed
by the House of Lords.</p>

<p class='c009'>Now we cannot suppose that
Bacon would plead guilty unless
there were really some corrupt
practices of which his conscience
told him he was culpable. To
suppose otherwise would, as Macaulay
has argued, convict him of a
dastardly conduct almost as infamous
as judicial corruption. But
although it is impossible to suppose
that there was not <em>something to confess</em>—something
culpable and illegal
to plead guilty to—yet it is very
possible that, by showing that he
was not more culpable than others,
he might have defended himself successfully
before the House of Lords.
A man of sterner stuff would
have adopted this line of defence;
he would have carried the war
into other territories. Of this the
Court was not at all desirous, and
Bacon, a lover of peace, thought it
the better bargain to plead guilty
and keep the King for his friend.</p>

<p class='c009'>We do not accuse the Lord
Chancellor of pleading guilty, and
being conscious of perfect innocence;
we say that he resigned a
line of defence which might have
been successful with his judges, in
obedience to the wishes of the
Court. In the position in which
he found himself, submission was
better policy than defence.</p>

<p class='c009'>It is idle to suppose that Bacon
received no presents but such as
would be classed under the head
of fees or customary donations:
there was the element of <em>secrecy</em> in
the transactions which were now
brought to light, and which were to
be made the subject of investigation
before the House of Lords. The
money was given, it is true, to an
officer of the Court; it was not
slipped into the hand, or dropped
stealthily into the sleeve of the
judge himself: but the officer of
the Court did not talk about such
transactions as these; he had the
proper <em>esprit de corps</em>, if he had no
other motive for silence. But still
there are many cases in which a
custom, acknowledged to be bad
and immoral even by those who
fall into it, is yet so prevalent that
it seems an injustice to single out
any one individual, and punish it in
him; and this seems to be the position
in which Bacon stands. An
illustration occurs to us in some of
the vicious customs of trade. The
illustration may not be very dignified,
but it is apposite. A little
time ago the public was suddenly
made aware of divers impositions
that had been long practised on
it. Some articles of commerce were
systematically adulterated; others
were sold under false descriptions.
Here were reels of cotton
warranted to contain 300 yards,
which did not contain say more
than 200; and it was reported at
the time (we of course do not vouch
for the truth of a statement which
we use only by way of illustration)
that respectable houses of trade
gave orders to the manufacturers
for reels of cotton which should be
marked as having a greater number
of yards than were actually wound
on them. Now let us suppose that
a custom of this kind prevails, and
that suddenly one man, and he not
the most flagrant offender, is singled
out for punishment. You cannot say
the man is guiltless—he will not
say himself that he is guiltless; he
never approved of the custom,
though he fell into it; he knew
that it could not bear the light of
day; he knew that though his own
class did not condemn the custom,
the moral opinion of society at large
would unhesitatingly denounce it.
He pleads guilty—as Bacon did—and
throws himself upon the charitable
construction of the public. And
the public, if it cannot pardon, will
not be disposed to punish severely.</p>

<p class='c009'>The difference between <em>a prevalent
bad custom</em>, and a custom which
society at a given time does not
pronounce <em>to be bad</em>, is stated by
Lord Macaulay with his usual force
and precision. We shall be glad to
hear, from the further investigation
of Mr Spedding, which of these
most strictly applies to the practice
of which Bacon stands accused.</p>

<p class='c009'>We cannot leave our subject without
expressing our assent (with
certain reservations) to the estimate
which Lord Macaulay has formed
of Bacon in his character of philosopher—in
that character in which
there can be only the difference of
more or less admiration.</p>

<p class='c009'>We admire—as who does not?—the
eloquent and far-seeing man
who perceived that too much of our
time was spent over books, and too
little in the study of that nature
which appeals at each moment to
our senses, and promises to those
who will investigate her laws new
powers as well as new knowledge.
But we agree with Macaulay in
setting little store upon the rules
of a new logic by which he offered
to aid the investigation of those
laws. No logic of any kind ever
taught a man to reason. No truth
was ever discovered by either Aristotelian
or Baconian logic. It may
be fit and proper to make the process
of reasoning a subject of subtle
analysis; but just as the poet must
come before the critic, and never
yet was formed by the critic, so the
reasoner comes before the logician,
and never yet was an able reasoner
made so by rules of logic. It was
a glorious word spoken in season,
to tell men to observe and to experiment—to
take nothing upon
mere tradition or authority that
could possibly be tested by experiment.
But the rules Bacon gives
for conducting observation and experiment
have never made a good
observer, or contributed themselves
to our scientific discoveries. “The
inductive method,” as Macaulay
says, “has been practised ever since
the beginning of the world by every
human being.... Not only
is it not true that Bacon invented
the inductive method, but it is
not true that he was the first person
who correctly analysed that method
and explained its uses. Aristotle
had long before pointed out the
absurdity of supposing that syllogistic
reasoning could ever conduct
men to the discovery of a new principle—had
shown that such discoveries
must be made by induction,
and by induction alone; and
had given the history of the inductive
process, concisely indeed,
but with great perspicuity and precision.”</p>

<p class='c009'>We for our part have always
noticed that when a man talks
much about “Baconian philosophy,”
he is going to stuff into our
ears some incredible nonsense. He
who has good evidence to bring
forward—trusts at once to his evidence.
Phrenologists, mesmerists,
spiritualists, all who have a very
weak case, are great discoursers on
the rules of induction. They eke
out their defective reasoning by
proving to us, whether we are
aware of it or not, that they are
very good reasoners. Most readers,
fortunately for themselves, are satisfied
with a few brilliant passages
of the ‘Novum Organum.’ If they
proceeded farther, they might find
that not only did it not assist them
in their researches after physical
truth, but that it embarrassed them
considerably as to the real nature
of physical science, and the kind
of truth to be sought for.</p>

<p class='c009'>Bacon was a great writer, a
great thinker, but he was not “the
father of modern philosophy.” If
we are to have fathers in science,
the title must be given to such men
as Galileo, Kepler, Newton. He
who discovers one great scientific
truth does more even for the logic
of science than any writer upon
that logic can perform.</p>

<p class='c009'>Science does not stand in <em>contradiction</em>
to the metaphysical or ethical
discussions of ancient or of
modern times. There is no <em>contrast</em>
such as is popularly described
between the old philosophy and the
new. But a vast <em>addition</em> has been
made to one kind of our knowledge.
And with regard to that great argument
of <em>utility</em> which Lord Macaulay
has so eloquently developed,
it must be borne in mind that the
utility of the physical sciences
made itself known by certain individual
discoveries and inventions,
not by mere abstract contemplation
of what the study of nature might
produce. In fact, the utility of
the pursuit was the very argument
which Socrates made use of
to draw men <em>from</em> the study of
objective nature to the study of
themselves. As matters then stood,
more seemed likely to be effected
by regulating the mind of man
than by observing the winds or the
clouds, or any of the phenomena of
nature.</p>

<p class='c009'>Let us carry ourselves back in
imagination to the state of philosophy
which existed at Athens in
the time of the Emperor Hadrian,
and which Mr Merivale has so pleasantly
described in his last volume
of ‘The History of the Romans under
the Empire.’ Philosophy seems
to have come to a dead-lock. “On
every side it was tacitly acknowledged
that the limits of each
specific dogma had been reached;
that all were true enough to be
taught, and none so true as to be
exclusively believed. Their several
professors lived together in conventional
antagonism, and in real
good-fellowship. Academics and
Peripatetics, Stoics and Epicureans,
Pyrrhonists and Cynics, disputed
together or thundered one against
the other through the morning,
and bathed, dined, and joked together,
with easy indifference,
through the evening.” Well, let us
suppose that amongst this conclave
a Baconian philosopher had presented
himself, with his new <em>organon</em>
and his speculations on the
new power men would derive, if,
with this <em>organon</em> in their hands,
they would proceed to the study of
nature. After some struggle to get
a footing in what Mr Merivale has
described as a most conservative
university, he would perhaps have
been allowed to open his school in
Athens, and he would have added
one more figure to that group of
philosophers who disputed in the
morning, and dined amicably together
in the evening. Another
admirable talker would have appeared
amongst them. This would
have been the whole result. But
now let us imagine that to this
Athens a Galileo had come with
his telescope and revealed the
satellites of Jupiter; let us imagine
that a Cavendish had come with
his electric battery and decomposed
water into two gases, one of which
burst readily into flame; what a
stir would there then have been
amongst all the schools and classes
of Athens! Still larger telescopes
would have been made, and the
electric battery applied to all sorts
of substances. An era of experimental
philosophy would at once
have been inaugurated.</p>

<p class='c009'>All honour to the great and eloquent
writer; but such palms and
such wreaths as Science has to
bestow are due to those who have
discovered scientific truths. These
are they who have really stirred
the minds of men as well as placed
power in their hands; and, without
gainsaying a word of what Lord
Macaulay has so brilliantly stated of
the utilities of science, it is worthy
of notice that in no department of
philosophy have truth and knowledge
been sought for with so much
avidity <em>purely for their own sakes</em>.
And it should be added that only
by the pursuit of knowledge for its
own sake <em>can</em> its utilities be developed.
For it is one thing to prosecute
science with a general conviction
that its truths will turn to
inventions for the good of man,
and quite another thing to set
before ourselves some desirable
end or object of a practical kind as
the goal to which we are striving.
This is what the alchemists did
when they set before themselves
the transmutation of metals as the
achievement to be accomplished.
To study nature under such guidance
as this would be a great mistake.
We may be wasting our time
on an impossibility; we should
certainly be narrowing the sphere
of our observation. But when we
strive in every direction to proceed
from the known to the unknown,
by seizing upon every new relation
which offers itself to the understanding,
then we can hardly fail
to stumble upon some discovery of
a practical utility. The passion for
knowledge sweeps all things into
our net, and we may find marvellous
treasures there we never
dreamt of. The higher sentiment
of the love of knowledge is that
which can alone conduct us to the
<em>utilities</em> of knowledge. We cannot
predict what science will enable us
to do, and then proceed with our
studies in order that we may accomplish
this end. It is science
which teaches us what new ends
can be accomplished. It is an ever-broadening
knowledge, procured immediately
for its own sake, that
opens up to us the new possibilities,
the new powers, that man may
aspire to and possess.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_499'>499</span>
  <h2 class='c002'>THE YEANG-TAI MOUNTAINS, AND SPIRIT-WRITING IN CHINA.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>That portion of China which
lies more immediately to the west
of the estuary of the Canton river,
comprising the Sun-on, Toong-koon,
Kinei-shin, and Tai-phoong districts,
is exceedingly mountainous,
and inhabited by a turbulent people,
constantly fighting among themselves,
and but little subject to mandarin
rule. Even still foreigners
scarcely ever visit it; and when,
during the war, I first commenced
to wander there, the field was entirely
my own; and many were the
prophecies that, if I returned at all,
it would be in at least a headless,
if not in a completely disjointed,
condition. The torture and murder,
a few years before, of six young
Englishmen at Hwang-chu-ku, near
Canton, when they were only taking
an afternoon stroll, had rendered
our countrymen particularly
chary of trusting their persons
in the hands of the Chinese;
and at the time my excursions
commenced, there was additional
danger, arising from the fact that,
though Canton was in the hands
of the Allied troops, the gentry of
the provinces still kept up a species
of warfare, and offered rewards for
our heads: so, while a few well-armed
sportsmen from Hong-Kong
might occasionally pass over to the
mainland immediately opposite, it
was deemed madness to think of
spending a night there, or to go
any distance into the country beyond.
But though the island of
“Fragrant Streams,” as the words
Hong-Kong signify, has some curious
caves and wild lonely spots, its
limits are so circumscribed that a
residence in it became extremely
irksome. To be sure, the quiet
old Portuguese city of Macao, with
its grotto of Camoens, could be
reached in four or five hours by
steamer, with the refreshing possibility,
as one or two cases proved,
of being pirated and murdered on
the way by the Chinese passengers;
a gunboat, too, would take us up to
Canton in about a day: but these
places, however interesting, soon
became insufficient; they began to
present themselves in the disagreeable
light of being only suburbs of
Hong-Kong, and I resolved to seek
entertainment elsewhere.</p>

<p class='c009'>Being unaware that some German
missionaries had, before the
war broke out, laboured in the
neighbouring districts, I had to feel
my way without any previous information
as to the character of the
different villages and towns, and so
incurred some dangers which otherwise
might have been avoided. The
first time of sleeping on the mainland
was in an ancestral hall, along
with a friend, whose Chinese teacher
even refused to escort us on account
of the supposed danger. The
next time, accompanied only by
some native coolies, to carry bedding
and provisions, I wandered for
nearly a week among the mountains,
and slept at whatever village
I happened to be at by sun-down,
without meeting any apparent danger,
or even unpleasantness. After
that—sometimes alone, sometimes
with others; sometimes in perfect
safety, and at others with extreme
risk—I made excursions innumerable.
The manner in which I thus
explored for myself the country
lying to the east of the firth of the
Canton river may have given it peculiar
charms; but the contrast of
its valleys and mountains to those
of Hong-Kong, and to those immediately
opposite that barren island,
would have been sufficient to endear
it to all who feel with Goethe,
that “the works of nature are ever
a freshly-uttered word of God.”
The wooded hills and beautiful
green valleys were pleasant haunts
after the chunam and rotten granite
of the mercantile city of Victoria.
Those were happy days spent among
the mountains of Kwang-tung—crossing
rugged passes, ascending
lofty peaks, bathing in deep, black
mountain-pools, loitering at wayside
tea-houses, or under the shade
of wide-spreading trees. Those
were pleasant evenings—though not
always undisturbed by danger, and
on the limited-intercourse principle—passed
beside some long-robed
teacher in the village schoolhouse,
some shaven monk in a Buddhist
monastery, or even in some opium-perfumed
junk, with half-piratical
mariners who would gamble the
whole night through. Perhaps,
gentle reader, you will not be averse
to accompany me on one of those
otherwise solitary excursions, and
so to gain, without the trouble or
danger, some little knowledge of
the country and the peasant people.
Our company will certainly not be
of the silver chopstick kind; but I
trust it will not be altogether disagreeable
or without profit.</p>

<p class='c009'>The trip I select was made in the
first warm days of the spring of
1860, after affairs had been settled
in the south of China, and no rewards
were out for the heads of
foreigners; but I took notes of it
at the time, which have kept it
fresh in recollection. At first I
used to carry my own provisions,
cooking utensils, &#38;c.; but after a
little further knowledge of the people
and their ways, all these were
dispensed with; for, besides the
expense, it was often difficult to
find accommodation for a retinue
of coolies, and their tendency to
jabber at unseasonable moments
was a source of constant annoyance.
A pair of chopsticks, a strip of
waterproof lined with cork, and a
couple of blankets for bedding, together
with a change of clothes, and
a flask or two containing stronger
waters than those which abound in
China, were soon found to be all
that was necessary, and would easily
be carried by a single coolie
when slung to the ends of a bamboo
pole carried on his shoulders—for
men accustomed to bear weights
in this way walk as easily with a
moderate burden as they do without
any. Aheung is my companion on
the present occasion. He is old, but
sturdy; he works more willingly
than younger men, and has an inestimable
peculiarity about the formation
of his mouth which renders
it next to impossible to understand
anything he says. Even his own
countrymen have difficulty in making
out his meaning, and I never
attempt it; so he cannot remonstrate
with me, and is placed in
the position of being a recipient of
orders, or, as Carlyle would phrase
it, of being passively pumped into
as into an empty bucket. Naturally,
Aheung is of rather a garrulous
disposition, and every now and
then he pours out a sudden flood
of complicated sounds, resembling
a mixture of Gaelic and Chinese;
but, on finding that nobody understands
him, he as suddenly subsides
into abashed silence. Though perfectly
honest, he is shrewd at a bargain,
and fond of receiving a <em>kumshan</em>,
or present, which he pronounces
<em>kwumchwha</em>. This old
gentleman is also extremely timid,
and apt to disappear at critical
moments. He goes with me on
excursions because he has a wife
who knows that it is for his interest
to do so, and makes him; but
he is seldom at his ease, and mutters
an inarticulate protest at every
new movement, or holds up his
hands and shrugs his shoulders,
assuming an aspect of despair. It
must be added that he is extremely
attentive, of a very kind disposition,
with much natural politeness,
and of great devoutness or religiosity.
I never met such a man
for worship. It was all one to
Aheung whether he was in an
ancestral hall, a Buddhist monastery,
a Tauist temple, or a Christian
chapel; he never let a chance
pass of going down upon his knees
and doing “joss-pidgin.” As some
men have an omnivorous appetite,
so my old Chinaman had a most
catholic appetite for worship, and
a taste for what Dr Brown calls
“fine confused feedin’!” On one
occasion he gave great satisfaction
to a missionary with whom we
were travelling, by his punctuality
in attending morning prayers: and
the missionary said to me, “That
seems a very good old man of
yours; I should not wonder if he
became a convert.” To my friend’s
annoyance, however, Aheung was
to be seen at the first temple we
came to waving a burning joss-stick,
and prostrating before an
image of the solemn-faced Buddha,
and was much astonished when
rebuked for this by the missionary.
With such an outfit and a
companion one is in light marching
order for an active rather than
a luxurious excursion; and as the
weather has begun to get warm,
I dispense with the inconvenience
of European shirt, waistcoat, coat,
and neck-tie, contenting myself
with a loose white China coat, having
no collar and no pressure at
the armpits, and covered by another
silk one of similar make and
dimensions. It would be difficult
to overrate the comfort and advantage
of such a costume to those
who have to take exercise in hot
weather. As to money, it is impossible
to burden my coolie with
any considerable sum in Chinese
“cash,” as there are a thousand of
that coin to the dollar; but ten or
twelve dollars will cover all the expenses
of the excursion, and that
we take in sycee silver, or dollars
broken up into small pieces, which
are preferred by the Chinese to the
entire coin, and in which small
payments can be made without the
trouble of changing.</p>

<p class='c009'>A “pull-away boat,” manned
chiefly by women, soon carried us
across the spacious harbour of
Hong-Kong, into a large bay, and
on to a fine sandy beach on the
opposite mainland. Here the magnificent
range of mountains which
lines the coast presents a low pass,
up which runs a steep cork-screw
path, by which we got to the other
side of them, and, winding along
for an hour, to a narrow wooded
gorge at the head of the Leuk-ün
valley, which, in the yellow evening
light, lay peacefully below,
fringed by thick dark woods, above
which rose imposing mountains of
picturesque form. It is well to
take it easy for the first two days,
so our resting-place that night was
a very short way down the valley,
at an ancestral hall in the village of
Kan-how. This hamlet comprised
not more than a dozen houses, but
their hall was large, clean, well
built, and served as a schoolhouse,
as well as for some other purposes.
On entering I found the old men
seated in arm-chairs, just finishing
a consultation on some important
subject or other, and the children
soon crowded in, in expectation of
the cash which it is both wise
policy and Chinese custom for
strangers to distribute amongst
them. The custodian of this pleasant
place was a one-eyed ancient
of most forbidding appearance. His
one eye not only did the business of
two, but gave the impression that
it had gone out of his head, and
was prowling about generally for
something or other. His exterior
semblance, however, did belie his
soul’s timidity; and his chief failing
was a peculiar passion for corks,
which he sought after and treasured
up with the avidity of a miser. I
used to keep a store of beer in this
ancestral hall, and on my visits he
always seemed to be troubled at
night by a suspicion that some cork
had escaped his search, or might
be abstracted from a bottle, and he
would rise to look for it. On one
occasion a friend just out from
England spent a night with me in
this place, and being by no means
assured of the safety of sleeping
among Chinese, the personal appearance
of the Uniocular caused
him a great deal of unnecessary
anxiety. He could not sleep because
of a vision he had of the
One-eyed progging at him with a
spear, and the One-eyed could not
sleep because of an imaginary cork!
The game which these two carried
on during the night was extremely
comical. Their small sleeping-rooms
were at opposite corners of
the joss-house, and not in sight of
each other, so they never actually
came in contact. First, the old
man would rise, light a reed, and,
bending almost double, with his
one eye glittering down upon the
black stone floor, search for the
object of his desire. Roused by the
noise made, or the glimmer of the
light, my friend would then rise
also, and, being unaccustomed to
such work, steal out in his stocking-soles,
peering into the darkness with
a lighted taper in one hand and a
revolver in the other. On hearing
the creaking of the boards when
his enemy arose, the cork-gatherer
always extinguished his light, and,
on catching a glimpse of the dreadful
apparition with the revolver,
stole off terrified to his own den,
not to re-emerge until all was quiet,
and some time had elapsed. Unfortunately,
it usually happened,
whenever I persuaded a friend to
go with me upon the mainland,
that some danger, or appearance of
danger, occurred, and prevented him
from repeating the visit.</p>

<p class='c009'>One advantage of sleeping upon
boards is, that it promotes early
rising; but ere I got up next morning,
the children of the hamlet were
in the temple, reading in their singsong
way the Chinese trimetrical
classic which they are taught to
commit to memory long before they
understand almost a word of its
meaning. The contrast which Celestial
children present to those of
the West is striking. They are
quiet, calm, perpetrate no tricks,
and rarely or never play about. In
fact, their demeanour is not unlike
that of aged Europeans; while the
old men, on the other hand, display
something of the liveliness of childhood,
especially when engaged in
their favourite amusement of flying
kites. Though teaching was thus
carried on in the temple, yet that
building was specially dedicated to
the worship of the ancestors of the
villagers. “The real religion of
China,” it has been truly said, “is
not the worship of heaven and
earth, nor of idols, but of Confucius
and of one’s own ancestors.”
The more educated classes, including
the mandarins, have special reverence
for Confucius; but the mass
of the people worship the spirits of
their ancestors with profound awe.
They believe that each family has
a close peculiar interest in all its
members, whether before or after
death, not one being able to suffer
without all being afflicted. Each
house has its <em>lararium</em>, in the shape
of a small temple, a room, or even
a niche in the wall, where the
family is poor. This hall at Kan-how
had many ancestral tablets
hung up in it, and also some for the
propitiation of <em>kwei</em>, or friendless
hungry spirits, for whom the Chinese
have a singular dread. Every district
in the country has a temple
with the tablets of all persons whose
families are extinct. To the imagination
of the yellow-skinned children
of Han there is something
very awful in the idea of a forlorn
shivering ghost, wandering through
the air without any progeny on
earth to care for it, to give it meat-offerings,
or the warm regard of
human hearts; and they believe
that such friendless spirits are always
likely to become malignant
powers, and to work them evil.
Some districts have a ceremony,
every ten years or so, called the
“Universal Rescue,” for the special
benefit of such spirits.</p>

<p class='c009'>The morning wore away pleasantly
as I was sitting on a little
terrace, shaded by a large tree, in
front of the ancestral hall. A number
of small villages dotted the ricefields
of the flat valley; and after
their morning meal the people came
out to their work, some carrying a
light plough behind the ox which
had to drag it, others with hoes
to weed the sweet-potato fields,
bands of laughing women going up
the mountains to cut grass, and one
gentleman taking a morning walk
with a long spear over his shoulder.
On returning from a visit to a curious
rock, called the “Mother and
Child,” from its resemblance to a
woman with an infant upon her
back, I found the school had
“scaled,” to use a Scotch phrase;
and the teachers, with the elders,
were engaged in purchasing articles
for a general dinner, and cutting
them up. In the discussion which
went on upon this subject a few of
the pot-bellied children who remained
took great interest, throwing
in their opinions with much
calmness and gravity.</p>

<p class='c009'>That afternoon I crossed over a
second range of mountains into another
valley, the path leading down
near the side of a huge black precipice,
which looked sublime in the
moonlight. Not a soul was met on
the latter part of the way, for when
night descends on China, the country
people confine themselves to
their own homes, and only bands
of robbers are to be met with, or
men out for some bloody purpose,
such as destroying a village with
which they are at war. I had sometimes
stopped, at the first village I
came to, in the house of an old
woman; and one evening, when
taking an English friend there, a
rather startling incident occurred.
As we came round a corner upon
the village, just as I was expatiating
upon the friendliness of the
people and the perfect safety we
would enjoy, a gingall was fired,
and the bullets came whistling
round our heads. My companion
looked as if he thought this fact
considerably outweighed my theory;
but it turned out that the gingall,
which takes some little time to go
off, had actually been fired before
we came in sight round the corner.
On this present occasion I went on
to another village called Chin-wan,
and slept in the house of a young
teacher, who remained up, or rather
lolling on his couch, till about one
in the morning, smoking opium
with a friend. It is a remarkable
fact that, with only one exception,
all the Chinese <em>dominies</em> I came
across were in the habit of smoking
opium. Probably this was caused
by the sedentary, harassing, and
dreary nature of their occupation,
which makes the soothing drug
specially desirable. At one place I
was told I could not see the teacher,
though it was the middle of the
day, because he was asleep from
opium. Fancy being told, and as
nothing out of the way, that a parochial
schoolmaster was invisible,
because he was dead drunk! The
Chinese, however, usually take
opium in moderation, after their
meals, just as we do beer and wine,
and no discredit attaches to such a
use of it. The practice is more fascinating
than the use of intoxicating
drinks, and more easily glides
into excess. Of teachers in China,
unfortunately for them, there is an
immense supply owing to the number
of disappointed candidates at
the competitive examinations for
the Government service. In this
Chin-wan schoolhouse I met a fat
man who had been in Hong-Kong,
and spoke a little English. If there
was any self-approval in my air in
telling him that I had walked over
the hills, it met with a speedy and
severe check, for he immediately
said—“Eiya! Hab walkee! allo
same one coolie.” This was complimentary,
but I had my revenge;
for the fat man told me that he
was a gentleman living at his ease,
whereas I discovered him, early
next morning, in a butcher’s shop,
with his sleeves tucked up dissecting
a fat pig, into whose entrails he
staggered on my finding him, and
exclaiming, “Hulloa! Allo same
one butcher.” It is due to the
Chinese, however, to state, that
very few of them are ashamed of,
or attempt to conceal, their occupations.</p>

<p class='c009'>Hitherto I had been trifling with
the excursion, but next day Aheung
knew by our starting early that
we were in for work; and deep
gloom came over his countenance
when he saw the direction I was
taking up the Chin-wan or Talshan
Valley, towards an old and totally
unfrequented path which leads over
a shoulder of the Tai-mon shan, or
“Great Hat Mountain.” No part
of the Scotch Highlands presents
a more picturesque appearance than
the upper part of this valley, so
plentifully are the small pines scattered
about, so deep the pools, so
wild the stream, so huge and fantastic
the shattered rocks. The
Great Hat Mountain, over a lower
portion of which we go, is about
4000 feet high, and terraced up to
the very top, showing it was cultivated
at some former period; but
now it is entirely without habitations,
and covered with long rank
grass of the coarsest kind, which
forms a serious obstacle to the
ascent. I got up to the top once,
with great difficulty, and was rewarded
by a magnificent panorama
of sea and islands, mountains and
plains. Even Canton could be seen
in the distance; the villages looked
as if they could be counted by
hundreds, and every island was
fringed round with numerous junks
and fishing-boats. Considering that
the country round is one of the
most sparsely populated parts of
China, the innumerable indications
of human life were somewhat surprising.
In conjunction with what
I have seen in more thickly habitated
parts of China, such as the
valleys of the great rivers, I incline
to think that the numbers
given by the last census which
I know of as available were certainly
not above the truth. It
was taken about 1840, and the
members of the Russian Legation
at Peking, who had access to it,
gave the entire population of the
Chinese empire at 412 millions.
An old legend regarding the Tai-mon
is, that a proprietor and feudal
chief in its neighbourhood gave protection
and support to the sister of
a dethroned Chinese emperor, and,
on the emperor regaining power, he
rewarded the chief by giving him
all the circle of country which he
could see from that mountain. It
would almost require some such reward
to induce one a second time
to encounter the fatigue and irritation
of ascending it in its present
condition. The Chinese have a
great idea of the influence of mountains,
speaking of them as more or
less “powerful,” but this one has
no particular reputation that way.
The old path we are now taking is
in great part overgrown with grass,
and leads through a complete mountain
solitude, where the silence is
broken only by the wind rustling
in the rank herbage, and no signs
of life meet the eye. Aheung motions
me to carry my revolver in
my hand; he is in an agony of
terror, and I can distinguish him
uttering the words <em>lu tsaak</em>, or road-robber,
and <em>lo foo</em>, or tiger—two
beings with which the Chinese imagination
peoples the whole country.
To hear them talk of tigers, one
would think these animals were as
thick as blackberries. Nothing was
more common than for villagers to
say to me, “There is a tiger about
here; would you be good enough to
go out and shoot it?” as if I had
only to step to the door in order to
find one; whereas the fact is, that
I never saw the slightest trace of
any, though a few certainly do
exist. At first I used to be startled
by the information constantly tendered
that there was a party of
road-robbers watching the path a
little way on; but as they never
appeared, I began to get quite sceptical
on the subject, until at last I
did unexpectedly meet with five of
them, armed with short swords, who
were holding the top of a mountain
pass. I was travelling in a chair at
the time, and on seeing this obstacle
my coolies at once put down
the chair, and refused to proceed
farther. I tried to represent to
them that though the robbers were
five, we were five also; they replied
that they were paid to carry me, not
to fight. Deeming it safer to go
forward than to go back, I walked
up to the men, revolver in hand;
and whenever they saw I was so
armed, they made off, greatly to my
relief, as only three chambers were
loaded. Chinese pirates and highwaymen
do not live to rob, but rob
to live; and so they like to be
pretty safe in what they do. As
they are lawless only to prolong
their lives, it seems to them the
height of absurdity to put themselves
in any decided peril for the
sake of plunder. Theirs is a highly
rational system, in consonance with
the practical tendencies of the Celestial
mind.</p>

<p class='c009'>Notwithstanding Aheung’s terrors,
we got quite undisturbed over
the Tai Mon, and reached before
dusk a solitary Buddhist monastery,
situated in a wood at the head
of and overlooking the Pak-heung,
or “Eight Village” Valley. As we
came down on this place, I heard
the firing of a clan-fight at one of
the villages below; and often as I
have been in the Pak-heung, never
have I been there without finding
a fight going on, either between
two or more of its own villages,
or between one or all of its villages
and those of the Shap-heung,
or “Ten Village” Valley, immediately
contiguous. They seemed
to have as much stomach for fighting
as Aheung had for worship,
and the blame was laid chiefly on
a large village called Kum-tin, or
“Fertile Land,” which suffered from
a plethora of wealth, and had disputed
claims to land in various directions.
Of all places I knew in
that neighbourhood, this monastery
was my favourite haunt, from the
view it commanded, its cleanliness,
its secluded position, and its internal
quiet. The two or three monks
occupying it were always glad to
see me, as I gave them presents,
and afforded relief to the tedium
of their life. On this occasion they
gave me, as usual, a hearty welcome;
but I was rather startled, on
being awakened about midnight by
loud shouts, knocking at the outer
door, and the flashing of torches
beneath my window. This turned
out to be some men from one of
the fighting villages, who had taken
it into their heads to come up to
the monastery at that unseasonable
hour for mingled purposes of
thanksgiving and jollification, and
who remained there till morning.
They were, however, perfectly civil,
and showed no disposition to interfere
with me in any way, except in
questioning Aheung as to where he
came from, and what clan he belonged
to. Had he been one of
that with which they were fighting,
the probability is they would have
made him a prisoner.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was delightful in the morning
to sit in the cool air on the terrace
in front of this cold or Icy-Cloud
Monastery, as it is called, and watch
the light mist rolling off the Pak-heung
Valley, and brightening over
the waters of Deep Bay. Soon
from every village the smoke of
household fires rose into the calm
clear air, while, every ten minutes
or so, the boom of a gingall came
from the combatants beneath, and
reverberated on the grand cliff behind
us. The young green rice of
the fields below was like a vast lake
lying round the villages and wooded
knolls, except where in the upper
slopes it flowed down from field to
field like a river, bearing good promise
for the stomachs of industrious
hungry men. The little wooded
islets rose from the rice sea with
their temples and ancestral halls as
out of the world’s everyday work
and life. On either side of the
wide Pak-heung were great, bare,
sublime blocks of mountains, with
white fleecy clouds occasionally
floating across God’s bright blue
sky, while fish were leaping in the
pond below, and doves were cooing
in the trees around.</p>

<p class='c009'>But one must have breakfast. The
resources of the country are confined
to rice, salted vegetables, and
bean-paste, which are not particularly
tempting; but we brought
some fish with us, and Aheung has
procured some eggs and pork in the
nearest village. Strictly speaking,
this being a Buddhist place of worship,
no food that has had life in
it should be allowed to enter; but
there are only two monks here at
present—an old man and a neophyte—and
my sacrilege is winked
at. Nay, it is more than winked
at, for, as we breakfast together,
the chopsticks of the monk gradually
deviate towards the palatable
fried salt-water fish. Curiously and
inquiringly he turns one over, and
then, as if satisfied with the result
of his careful examination, the old
sophist exclaims, “<em>Hai tsai!</em>”—“Vegetables
of the sea!” and immediately
swallows a piece. Under
this cunning and specious phrase
he continues to dispose of a very
fair quantity of fish; but the pork
was a little too much for his conscience,
and he affected not to see
it at all. He also pretended, my
hair being cropped close, to believe
that I was a Buddhist. On learning
that we were going to a place called
Li-long, he briefly informed me that
the men of Li-long were robbers,
and immediately thereafter shovelled
in a vast quantity of rice into
his mouth, as if he were afraid to
say anything more on that painful
subject. This monk, who was quite
hale and strong, said he was seventy
years old, and looked as if he might
live as many more. His occupations,
which he took very easily,
were praying, chanting, bowing,
and reading. The Chinese Buddhists
have the idea that, by retiring
to solitary places, avoiding
bodily activity and all sensual indulgence,
living with extreme temperance,
and spending their days in
meditation and prayer, the vital
power is preserved in the system,
and gradually collects towards the
crown of the head, until at last the
devotee gains the possession of supernatural
powers. I did not observe
that this old gentleman was
distinguished in that particular;
and the neophyte, it is to be
feared, was in a bad way, for I once
detected him, the monk being absent,
sitting down with a youthful
visitor to a dinner where figured
the unholy articles of fowl, pork,
and Chinese wine, of the two former
of which he partook. On a previous
visit to this place, a wicked
friend of mine, who had full command
of the language, disturbed
the mind of the neophyte by ardent
praise of the gentler sex;
and on reading the inscription,
“May the children and grandchildren
of the contributors [to the
monastery] gloriously increase,” he
asked him how he could expect his
children to increase! This youth
was also fond of reading Christian
tracts in Chinese. Altogether, what
with forbidden literature, forbidden
diet, and discourses on the
forbidden sex, I fear the neophyte
will never attain to miraculous
powers.</p>

<p class='c009'>These Buddhist temples and monasteries
are thickly scattered over
China. They are often buildings
of great size, and afford the best
resting-place for travellers, but
usually the staff of priests is very
small indeed, and these bear no
very good name among the people.
This one of the Icy Cloud had not
so much as a dozen rooms of various
sizes, but it was compact and
well built. The walls had a few
frescoes of non-perspective landscapes,
with grotesque devils in the
foreground; there were also statues of
Buddha, of Kiu-tsaang-keun, or the
“Heavenly General,” and of Koon
Yum, the Hearer of Cries, or Goddess
of Grace, to whom it was specially
dedicated. Worshippers were
very rarely to be seen in it. Many
inscriptions, of which the following
are examples, were hung upon the
walls:—</p>

<p class='c010'>“It is easy to leave the world; but if
the heart is gross, and you cannot cease
thinking of the mud and trouble of life,
your living in a deep hill is vain.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“To be a Buddhist is easy, but to
keep the regulations is difficult.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“It is easy to preach doctrines (<em>taali</em>),
but to apprehend principles is difficult.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“If you do not put forth your works,
but only preach, your strength is emptily
wasted; and if you talk till you
break your teeth, even then it will be
in vain.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“If you are entirely without belief
and desire (will), and do not attend to
the prohibitions, then your strength will
have been uselessly wasted, and your
head shaved to no purpose.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“May the precious ground (of the
monastery) be renewed.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“To be intimate, and not divided,
consists in the virtuous roots being
gathered in a place.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“When the image was asked why it
turned round and fell backward, it said,
‘Because the people of the time would
not turn their heads;’” [they probably
being a stiff-necked generation, like the
people of many other times and places.]</p>

<p class='c013'>“Peacefully seclude and regulate
yourselves.”</p>

<p class='c008'>It will be observed that some of
these inscriptions are most sensible
as well as appropriate. While the
last is quite in place in such an institution,
it is wisely modified by
the five first, which show how retirement
can be made profitable,
or at least warn against its being
unprofitable. The seclusion of a
monastery can only be of advantage
to those who, having experienced
the turmoil and passion of
worldly life, really know its bitterness,
and desire something better.
It is not only the old monk who
breaks his teeth in vain, or the
neophyte who shaves his head to
no purpose. Youth is the time for
action—for “the mud and trouble
of life”—and in vain do men try to
evade it by planting the unhappy
slip “in a deep hill,” bidding him
observe “the trees of the clouds
and the flowers of the mountains,”
or oppressing him with moral and
religious ideas which he cannot
appreciate. Old age, again, is the
proper period for meditation and
wisdom. How often, in all countries,
do we see the virtues suitable
to one period of life, or to one
station of life, forced upon persons
of other ages and of different
stations, until their souls revolt
within them against all virtue
whatever!</p>

<p class='c009'>Passing northward from the
“Eighth Village” Valley, we walked
over undulating moorland, broken
by low hills covered with
white quartz, passing one village
called Kum-chin, or the “Golden
Cash,” which was surrounded by
acres of large fir-trees, lychus and
other fruit-trees, well stocked with
doves; and another which bore the
fragrant name of Wa-cheang, or
“Fine-smelling Grain,” though
eminently dirty, and surrounded
by a stagnant ditch. About two
miles after crossing a creek, we
skirted the small walled town of
Sam-chun, but took good care not
to enter. Doubtless at that time
we might have done so with tolerable
safety, but I once had such a
narrow escape in that place, that I
had no desire whatever again to
tempt its hospitality. Sam-chun is
a mart of bad repute, being at the
head of a creek, and rather a depôt
for goods, frequently pirated, rather
than giving hostage for its respectability
in cultivation of the soil.
Aheung, who was an old man himself,
explained its iniquities by the
fact that there were few or no old
men to be found in it. The first
time I visited it, along with a
friend, hostilities were going on at
Canton, and rewards were out for
the heads of foreigners. One of
our coolies asked us to go into a
shop in the town which was kept
by some relatives of his, and in
doing so we passed through two
small gateways, and also the butchers’
bazaar. The shopmen received
us very well, but we had
scarcely time to drink a cup of tea
before the room was filled by a
crowd of ruffians, chiefly butchers
from the neighbouring bazaar,
armed with knives and choppers.
They first began shouting derisively,
pressing in and hustling us;
then got up the cry “<em>Tá tá!</em>”—“Strike,
strike!” with which Chinese
commence all their assaults;
and then the ominous words “<em>Fanquiei
sha tao</em>”—“Cut off the heads of
the Foreign Devils”—coupled with
some remarks as to what amount
of dollars these articles would bring
at Fat-shan. Those who know only
the ordinary placid appearance of
the Chinaman, have happily little
idea of the spectacle he presents
when working himself into a fury,
or the atrocities which he is capable
of committing. The butchers
round us—and there must have been
nearly a hundred in the shop—were
pushing one another on and rapidly
rising to blood-heat. Another
minute would have proved fatal,
and as it was, I had no hope of final
escape, the only ambition which
occurred being that of getting up
into a loft close to where I stood,
and where our revolvers could have
been used with effect. The coolie
who brought us into the fix wanted
us to fire, but that would have been
madness, pressed in as we were by
the crowd. Fortunately the shopkeepers,
and some more respectable
Chinese who were beside us, so far
took our part as to assist in getting
us hustled out through a door before
the bolder of the ruffians had quite
worked their way to us; and as we
got through, a yell of rage and disappointment
rose from the crowd; and
it is to be feared that the shopmen
suffered, for there was a general row
inside, with great crashing of furniture.
As the crowd could not get
quickly out of the shop, we had the
start of it in the streets, but were
soon overtaken by the rabble, who
pressed closely on us and threw
bricks, besides exhausting indecent
language in their remarks. Luckily
they were rather afraid of our revolvers,
and the street was too narrow
to allow of their passing to get
the gates shut. They called upon
the Chinamen we passed at shop
doors and side streets to strike us
down; and one individual offered
to do so with a long hoe, but failed,
while on others we tried very hard
to smile blandly, as if the whole
affair were a joke or a popular ovation.
Even on the plain beyond
the crowd followed us for two miles;
some men from a neighbouring village,
armed with gingalls, threatened
to cut off our retreat, and a
number of junkmen, with filthy
gestures and language, invited us
to stop and fight them, as if two
strangers, just escaped from imminent
death, were at all likely to
delay for the pleasure of encountering
about two hundred pirates. As
my friend could not swim, I was
afraid we might be brought up at
the creek; but the boat was just
starting, and, by holding a revolver
to his head, we persuaded the ferryman
to take us over, notwithstanding
the counter-threats addressed
to him by those of the ruffians who
had still continued to follow.</p>

<p class='c009'>The whole affair took us so much
by surprise, and there was such
necessity for immediate action, that
we did not fully realise it until we
were safe enough to take a rest,
when we both began to feel rather
faint, and had immediate recourse
to our flasks for a glass of brandy.
I experienced, however, a peculiarly
disagreeable sensation when the
crowd was howling round us in the
shop; it was not fear of the consequences,
but a kind of magnetic
effect from the noise and brutal
hostility of so many human beings.
A little terrier-bitch which I had
with me, and which I carried out
in my arms, as otherwise it would
have been trampled down, was so
affected by this that it trembled
violently, quivering like an aspen
leaf. There is something very trying
in the hostility of a howling
crowd, and a species of almost
physical effluence goes out from it
beyond visible positive action. A
man who was lynched in Texas a
few years ago, and whom a party
of soldiers tried to save, was so
affected by the conflict round him
that he besought his friends either
to hang him or to give him up at
once. I have heard an old Californian
settler say that it was nothing
to be in a stampede of wild cattle,
compared with being surrounded
by a crowd of either terrified or infuriated
men.</p>

<p class='c009'>This occurrence, I daresay, is a
sufficient excuse for my never having
again entered Sam-chun, though
often passing it. The General commanding
her Majesty’s forces at
Canton got, at our complaint, the
Governor of Kwang-tung to issue a
proclamation warning against the
recurrence of similar outrages; but
the Governor-General exercises very
little power in that part of the
country. Sam-chun is a place of
very bad general repute, and even
Chinese travellers carefully avoid
it, so I had no desire to experiment
as to the actual effect of the proclamation.
Aheung was with me
when this perilous incident occurred;
but he carefully disappeared,
and only turned up again towards
evening, carrying a basket, which
he had saved, as the excuse for his
absence. After we are fairly past
Sam-chun on this our present excursion,
he turns round to look at
it, grins at me, and draws his hand
significantly across his throat. We
stop this night at his own village
of San-kong, a little further on,
and sleep in the schoolhouse, which
is large and airy. Moved by the
report of my coolie, the people there
were particularly civil; and Aheung
insisted on providing the morning
and evening repast, with abundance
of hot <em>t’san</em>, or Chinese wine, at his
own expense. He also brought his
very aged mother to see me, and
she would have <em>kow-towed</em> had I
allowed her. Frequently the Chinese
are accused of ingratitude, but
I must say I have always found a
very strong desire on their part to
reciprocate favours. At this place
a rather curious proposal was made
by a Chinese traveller who was
halting at a tea-house in front of
the village. On seeing me he took
off his coat and displayed to the
people his bare back, which was
cruelly scored by the strokes of a
rattan. “See,” he said, “how the
foreign devils in Hong-Kong treat
a respectable Chinaman: now that
we have got this foreign devil
amongst us, let us tie him up and
flog him, and see how he will like
it.” Immediately on this Aheung’s
inarticulate voice rose in vehement
protest, and the people would not
listen to the proposal for a moment;
but it made my back shiver, for
had it been advanced in a village
where I was unknown, it might
very possibly have been carried into
execution—which would have
been neither profit nor glory, and
would have been all the harder because
I strongly disapproved of the
way in which such punishments
were carried out by the police. It
used to be a most horrid spectacle
to see, as often might be done, a
poor wretch, with his back all raw
and bloody, exposed in Queen’s
Road, the most crowded thoroughfare
of the town, trembling from
pain, shame, and cold, and trying
to conceal his face from the passers-by.
I could not wonder if a man
who had so suffered tried to murder
a dozen Europeans, especially if he
had suffered unjustly, as was nearly
as likely to be the case as not, or
for some trivial offence, such as
stealing three hairs from a horse’s
tail, for which I have known a
flogging with the rattan inflicted.</p>

<p class='c009'>Our next day’s journey was also
a short one of only twelve miles.
Shady paths along the side of a
stream led us to Pu-kak, a large
Hakka village, where the German
missionaries had formerly a station
in the <em>hue</em>, or marketplace, but
were forbidden to enter the village
itself, or to walk on a neighbouring
hill, lest they should disturb the
dragon beneath, who could not be
supposed to stand the insult of
foreigners trampling upon his neck!
At the outbreak of hostilities at
Canton, the Rev. Messrs Lobschied
and Winnes, who were labouring
here, were assailed by the people,
and had to barricade themselves in
their house. The former gentleman
got out at night by a back window;
and, being pursued, escaped by concealing
himself in the water and
among the lotus-leaves of a small
pond, enjoying the pleasure, while
lying there, of hearing the Chinese
thrusting their long spears close to
him. Mr Winnes was held to ransom
for 240 dollars, and was released;
but it is doubtful whether
that would have taken place had a
small military force not been despatched
from Hong-Kong for his
relief.</p>

<p class='c009'>At Li-lang, or the village of
“Flourishing Plums,” which we
next reached, I was glad to find
Mr Winnes, and to stay with him.
He had been residing there alone,
most of the time, for nearly six
months, in a small room above a
very small chapel and schoolhouse,
which were built before the commencement
of the war. All his
attempts to get a suitable site for a
house had been unsuccessful, owing
to the geomantic fears of the Hakkas.
At one place they were afraid
that the White Tiger, whatever that
may be, would be disturbed by his
building. Another suitable site
was refused because the spirits of
the ancestors wandering about the
graves on the opposite hill would
be disturbed by any change of the
aspect of the scene, such as a new
house would cause. This geomancy
is a rather mysterious and difficult
subject, which has its own priests,
and exercises much influence over
the minds of the Chinese. One of
the converts of the missionary had
been a geomancer, and had written
an essay on the subject, in which
he makes mention of such awful
things as the Deadly Vapour around
the dwelling, the Fiery Star which
brings destruction, the Nightly Dog
who causes apparitions, the Abandoned
Spirits who promote ignorance,
the White Tiger of the Heavenly
Gate, the Seven Murderers,
the Gate of Death, the Pestilential
Devil, the Hanging Devil,
the Strangler, the Poisoner, the
Knocker at the Door, the Lamenting
Devil, the Scatterer of Stones,
the Barking Dragon, the Ravenous
Heavenly Dog, and the Murderer
of the Year. Talk of the Chinese
not being an imaginative people!
Why, these mere names suggest a
whole world of terror; they are
enough to make one shudder and
have recourse immediately to a
solemn study of the seventy-two
principles of the mysterious laws of
the efficacious charm for protecting
houses.</p>

<p class='c009'>Another interesting subject on
which Mr Winnes gave me novel
information was the practice of
Spirit-Writing among the Chinese,
which has existed from an early
period, and strikingly resembles
the Western Spirit-Rapping of
modern times. I have pretty full
notes on this <i><span lang="de">Geister Shrift</span></i>, as the
German called it, but must avoid
tedious details. It is sometimes
had recourse to by mandarins and
educated persons, as well as by the
ignorant, for the purpose of gaining
information as to the future intentions
of Heaven, which are otherwise
hid from human beings. One
of the most frequent inquiries put
is as to whether the questioner will
have a number of male children,
but all sorts of subjects are inquired
into, both personal and political;
and many volumes exist, both in
prose and verse, alleged to have
been written by spirits; so the Seer
of Poughkeepsie has been anticipated
in the Flowery Land. The
Spirit-Writing is called by the
Chinese <em>Kong-pit</em>, or “Descending
to the Pencil,” and the first step is
to cut a bent twig from an apricot
tree, affixing at the same time to
the tree certain characters which
notify that the twig or magic pencil
is taken, because the spirit will
descend in order to reveal hidden
things. Having thus consoled the
tree for its loss, the twig is cut into
the shape of a Chinese pen, and
one end is inserted at right angles
into the middle, not the end, of a
piece of bamboo, about a foot long
and an inch thick, so that were this
bamboo laid upon a man’s palms
turned upwards, the twig might
hang down and be moved over a
piece of paper. In a temple, a
schoolhouse, or an ancestral hall,
chairs are then set apart for the
spirit to be summoned, and for the
god or saint of the temple or village
under whose power the summoned
spirit is supposed to be wandering.
One table is covered with flowers,
cakes, wine, and tea for the refreshment
and delectation of the
supernatural visitors, while another
is covered with fine sand, in order
that the spirit may there write its
intimations. In order to add to
the solemnity of the scene, proceedings
are not commenced till after
dark, and the spectators are expected
to attend fasting, in full dress,
and in a proper frame of mind.</p>

<p class='c009'>The usual way of communicating
in China with the higher supernatural
powers is by writing supplications
or thanksgivings on red
or gold-tissue paper, and then burning
the paper, the idea being that
the characters upon it are thus conveyed
into a spiritual form. In
order to spirit-writing, a piece of
paper is burnt containing some
such prayer as this to the tutelary
deity or saint of the place:—“This
night we have prepared wine and
gifts, and we now beseech our great
Patron to bring before us a cloud-wandering
spirit into this temple,
in order that we may communicate
with him.” After the saint has had
sufficient time to find a spirit, two
or three of the company go to the
door to receive him, and the spirit
is conducted to the seat set apart
for him, with much honour, with
many genuflexions, and the burning
of gold paper. The bamboo is
then placed in the palms of a man,
so that the apricot twig touches the
smooth sand upon one of the tables;
and it is usually preferred that the
person in whose hands the magic
pen is thus placed should be unable
to write, as that gives some guarantee
against collusion and deception.
It is then asked if the spirit
has arrived from the clouds; on
which, if he is there, the spirit
makes the bamboo shake in the
hands of the individual who is
holding it, so that the magic twig
writes on the sand the character
<em>to</em>, or “arrived.” When it is thus
known that the supernatural guest
is present, both he and the tutelary
deity are politely requested to seat
themselves in the arm-chairs which
have been provided, the latter, of
course, being on the left, or in the
post of honour according to Chinese
ideas. They are then refreshed by
the burning of more paper, and by
the pouring out of wine, which
they are thus supposed spiritually
to drink; and those who wish to
question the ghost are formally introduced
to it, for nothing would
be considered more shocking than
for any one suddenly and rudely
to intrude himself upon its
notice. After these ceremonies, it
is thought proper that the visitor
from the clouds should communicate
something about himself; so
inquiries are made as to his family
and personal names, the period at
which he lived, and the position
which he occupied. The question
as to time is usually made by asking
what dynasty he belonged to,
a few hundred years more or less
not being thought anything of
among this ancient people, and a
ghost of at least a thousand years
old being preferred to younger and
consequently less experienced persons.
The answers to these questions
are given as before, the spirit,
through the medium, tracing characters
upon the sand.</p>

<p class='c009'>After that, those who have been
introduced to the invisible guest
put their inquiries as to the future.
The questions and the name of the
questioner are written upon a piece
of gold paper, as thus:—“Lee Tai is
respectfully desirous to know whether
he shall count many male children
and grandchildren.” “Wohong
would gladly know whether his son
Apak will obtain a degree at the examination
at Canton next month.”
The paper with the question is then
burned, and the spirit moves the
magic pen until an answer, most
frequently in verse, is traced upon
the sand. If the bystanders cannot
make out the answer, the
ghostly interpreter will sometimes
condescend to write it again, and to
add the word “right” when it is at
last properly understood. After
the sand on the table is all written
over, it is again rolled smooth, and
the kind spirit continues its work.
When the answer is in verse, the
bystanders often take to flattery,
and say, “The illustrious spirit
has most distinguished poetical
powers.” To which the illustrious
spirit usually replies, in Chinese—“Hookey
Walker!” Whenever
a question is put, the paper is
burned and wine is poured out; for
Chinese ghosts appear to be thirsty
souls, and are not above reprimanding
those who neglect to give them
wine, or do not regard their utterances
with sufficient respect. It is
believed that the man in whose
hands the magic pen lies has nothing
to do with its movements,
and its motions can be easily seen,
and cause some little noise, thumping
down on the table.</p>

<p class='c009'>These operations go on till shortly
after midnight, when, according to
the principles of Chinese physical
science, the <em>yung</em>, or male principle
of life, gains the ascendancy. I am
not aware that any covert satire is
intended in thus making the ghost
loquacious only when under the
influence of the <em>yong</em>, or female
principle; but it may be so, or
there may be something in common
in this respect between Chinese
spirits and the ghosts of our own
land, which used to vanish at the
first crowing of the cock. At all
events, soon after midnight, the
celestial visitor, who is not less
formally polite than Chinese still
in the flesh, writes on the table—“Gentlemen!
I am obliged for your
liberal presents, but now I must
take my departure.” The gentlemen
reply to this, still through the
medium of burned paper—“We
beseech the illustrious ghost still
to remain with us a little longer,
and still further to enlighten our
minds.” “Permit me to go,” politely
answers the spirit, “for I
am urgently required elsewhere;”
whereon the whole assembly rises,
and, advancing to the door with
burning papers, escort the ghost out,
complimenting him, bowing to him,
and begging for his pardon if they
have at all failed in doing him
honour. At the door they respectfully
take leave of him, and allow
him to wander on into the darkness
and the clouds.</p>

<p class='c009'>It is curious to find that this
supposed modern form of delusion,
or else of communication with the
spirit world, has been in existence
in the Middle Empire for centuries,
and it is only one of many things
recently springing up in Europe
which have been anticipated by the
Celestials. A good deal of faith is
attached to these ghostly utterances,
and the ceremonies are conducted
with solemnity. It may be observed
that communication with the
supernatural world by means of
burned papers is not an isolated
notion in the circle of Chinese
ideas. Everything is considered as
having an existence beyond that
which it presents to the bodily eye.
Even inanimate objects may be said
to have a soul; and things (to use
the word in its widest sense) have
the same relationships to each other
in their spiritual as in their visible
existence. Thus, the spirits of the
dead must eat, whether they be in
heaven or hell, in clouds or sunshine.
They devour not spiritual
turnips, rice, and pork, but the
soul or spiritual existence of visible
turnips, rice, and pork; and, like
other Chinese, they prefer fowl,
ducks, and birds’-nest soup, when
they can get these luxuries. So far
is this carried, that in the “Universal
Rescue,” to which I have
already referred, separate bathing-rooms
are set apart for spirits of
the different sexes, in which they
are supposed to perform their spiritual
ablutions. Thus the present
and the past, the visible and the
invisible, are inseparably connected,
while both are seen to shape the
unformed future.</p>

<p class='c009'>At Li-long Mr Winnes had a small
congregation of converts from among
the peasantry, and a few intelligent
young men whom he was training
for missionary or educational purposes;
hymns were sung in Chinese,
but set to German music. Besides
conveying instruction, the missionaries—who
have all studied medicine
more or less—give medicine
and medical treatment to many of
the Chinese with whom they come
in contact, and try to cure inveterate
debauched opium-smokers by
taking them in charge for two or
three weeks, keeping them under
their own eye, and supplying such
drugs as are necessary to prevent
the system from breaking up when
the narcotic food on which it has
been accustomed to depend is withdrawn.
Credit is due to these educated
and intelligent men who thus
cut themselves off from the enjoyments
of their own civilisation, and
devote themselves to the improvement
of a somewhat rude and wild
people like those who inhabit these
mountainous districts of Kwang-tung.
In many respects their work
is important, and especially as acting
as a “buffer,” to use a railway
phrase, between two antagonistic
races and antagonistic civilisations.
In ordinary circumstances they are
treated not merely with respect, but
also with a friendly confidence rarely
extended to foreigners, though when
war is abroad and the minds of the
people are exasperated their services
may be forgotten. By mingling
with the people, speaking their
language, sympathising with their
humble joys and sorrows, and alleviating
their sufferings, they present
the foreigner in a new and beautiful
light to the Chinese, and dissipate
the prejudice which has attached
itself to his name.</p>

<p class='c009'>On leaving Li-long next day the
German missionary asked me to
visit a village called Ma-hum, in the
Yeang-tai Mountains, to which I was
bound, as it had suffered severely
in a prolonged clan-fight, and he
thought that the advent of a foreigner
would give its inhabitants
some little prestige which might
save them from the utter destruction
with which they were threatened
by the neighbouring and more
powerful village of Schan-tsun.
As the day was warm and the way
was long, I engaged a chair and a
couple of coolies, who went on
sturdily through narrow valleys between
low hills frequently covered
with pine-apple trees or rather
bushes. After passing the large
wealthy village of Tsing-fer, or
“Clear Lake,” where there are some
enormous trees, and, among others,
a bastard banian, the trunk of which
is forty feet in circumference, we
began to enter the Yeang-tai Mountains,
where the Throne of the Sun
is supposed to be situated. At
first they appeared not nearly so
beautiful and striking as when I
had visited them the previous summer.
At that time the orchards of
peach, plum, pear, and apple trees,
which form the main attraction of
the valleys, were loaded with leaves,
blossoms, and fruit; the grass was
everywhere green; the red sides of
the more barren hills were diversified
by numerous waterfalls and
foaming streams; while fantastic
clouds, here dark and threatening,
but there lit golden by the sunlight,
wreathed the summits of the mountains.
In this dry season the more
western portions of the Yeang-tai
looked bare and unsatisfactory.
The spring was not sufficiently advanced
for the trees to show more
than barely visible, though budding
knobs; the grass on the hills was
dry and yellow, and our path wound
away through interminable small
valleys, where the slopes around
seemed neither solid rock nor fruitful
earth, but ridges of decayed
granite which the rains had washed
bare and the sun had bleached to
a dirty reddish-white. It was like
finding a once fair lady in a faded
condition and a dubious undress.
The fruits which form the product
of this district are not particularly
satisfactory to European judgment.
The plums, apricots, and peaches,
though small, are much the best;
but it is difficult to get them in
good condition, as the Chinese seem
to prefer them either unripe or rotten;
and they are always gathered
too soon, partly on this account and
partly to preserve them from the
ravages of birds and thieves. The
large juicy pears are exceedingly
coarse-grained, and have not much
taste; the pulp feels dry and gritty
in the mouth, and the only way to
enjoy them properly is to eat them
stewed. The dry leathery apples
are miserable indeed. Those fruits
in the south of China which belong
to the tropical zone are much better
than those whose proper place is in
the temperate.  The pine-apples,
the custard-apples, the guavas, the
pomegranates, and the olives are
very good indeed; but the mangos
are small, and much inferior to
those of India, Manilla, and the
Straits. Some fruits are indigenous
and peculiar to the country, as the
<em>whampee</em>, which tastes not unlike a
gooseberry; and the <em>lychu</em> (whose
trees form a fragrant and agreeable
feature in the landscape), which is
about the size of a large strawberry,
and has, within a rough red skin, a
white sweet watery pulp, somewhat
resembling that of the mangosteen,
and not unpleasant to the taste,
though the flavour suggests a faint
suspicion of castor-oil. It is scarcely
necessary to make mention of the
numerous varieties of the orange,
which is the most abundant and
perfect fruit in the south of China.</p>

<p class='c009'>As we advanced into the larger
valleys and among the higher hills,
the scenery became more picturesque;
and often, far up the mountains,
were some large white graves.
The Chinese are unlike all other
nations in their treatment of the
dead. In the first place, they like
to have their own coffins ready and
in their houses, being in no way
disturbed by having such a <i><span lang="la">memento
mori</span></i> constantly before their eyes.
I once heard two women disputing
violently in Hong-Kong, and on inquiring
into the cause, the younger
one said to me in “pidgin English,”
“That woman belong my moder.
I have catchee she number one
piccy coffin, and she talkee, ‘No
good, no can do!;’” <em>Anglice</em>:
“That woman is my mother. I
have got for her a coffin of the best
kind, and she says it’s not good,
and won’t do!” After death the
body is closed up in a coffin along
with quicklime. This is often kept
for some time in the house, and
then, most frequently, the bones
are taken out and placed in an
earthenware urn. The most usual
form of the grave is an attempt at
representing the shape of an armchair
without legs, but this is often
thirty or forty feet round, and is
built of stone, or of bricks covered
with white chunam. At the back
of this the urn is placed in an excavation,
and the spirit of the defunct
is supposed to seat himself
there and enjoy the view. Care is
taken to give him a dry place, where
he will not be disturbed by damp
or streams of water, and where the
spiritual existence of ants will not
annoy. The Chinese love of nature
comes out remarkably in their selection
of spots for graves. They
prefer solitary places, where sighing
trees wave over the departed, the
melody of birds will refresh his
spirit, where he can gaze upon
a running stream and a distant
mountain-peak. In the ‘Kia Li,’
or Collection of Forms used in
Family Services, there occurs the
following beautiful funeral lament,
which is wont to be uttered at
burial:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c020'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“The location of the spot is striking,</div>
      <div class='line'>The beauty of a thousand hills is centred here. Ah!</div>
      <div class='line'>And the Dragon coils around to guard it.</div>
      <div class='line'>A winding stream spreads vast and wide. Ah!</div>
      <div class='line'>And the egrets here collect in broods.</div>
      <div class='line'>Rest here in peace for aye. Ah!</div>
      <div class='line'>The sighing firs above will make you music.</div>
      <div class='line'>For ever rest in this fair city. Ah!</div>
      <div class='line'>Where pines and trees will come and cheer you.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>Much more than that in which lies
the tomb of Shelley is the situation
of some of these Celestial graves
fitted to make one “in love with
death,” and there is much consoling
in the thought which the
Chinaman can entertain, that when
the cold hand has stilled the beatings
of the troubled heart, his disembodied
spirit does not want a
home, his name and memory are
perpetuated in the ancestral hall,
his wants are provided for, and the
daughter whom he left a child feels
that he is near her even to her old
age. How different these convictions
from the melancholy complaint
of Abd-el-Rohaman, the Arab
poet, as, fancying himself in the
grave, forsaken and forgotten by
all his kin, he wrote:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c020'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“They threw upon me mould of the tomb and went their way,—</div>
      <div class='line'>A guest, ’twould seem, had flitted from the dwellings of the tribe.</div>
      <div class='line'>My gold and my treasures, each his share, they bore away,</div>
      <div class='line'>Without thanks, without praise, with a jest and with a jibe.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“My gold and my treasures, each his share, they bore away;</div>
      <div class='line'>On me they left the weight, with me they left the sin.</div>
      <div class='line'>That night within the grave, without hoard or child, I lay:</div>
      <div class='line'>No spouse, no friend was there, no comrade and no kin.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“The wife of my youth soon another husband found;</div>
      <div class='line'>A stranger sat at home on the hearthstone of my sire;</div>
      <div class='line'>My son became a slave, though unpurchased, unbound,</div>
      <div class='line'>The hireling of a stranger who begrudged him his hire.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>The Celestial does not regard
death as the termination of delights
or separation of companions, and he
comforts himself with the thought
that the affectionate wishes of all
his kin will follow him into Dead
Man’s Land, that he will there
enjoy companionship, that his spirit
may hover for ever over the village
and the stream, reverenced to latest
generations, influencing the fruitfulness
of the all-nourishing earth,
the sweep of the winds of heaven,
and the courses of the life-giving
streams. Until some better ideas
be introduced, it would be a pity
were this belief disturbed, as it
exercises a powerful influence for
good by leading the Chinese mind
from things seen and temporal—for
which it is apt to have too
much respect—towards those which
are unseen and eternal. It gives
to his horizon the awe of another
world, and has much effect in
preserving those family relationships
which lie at the foundation
of Chinese social success. It also
has a singular effect in consoling
the bereaved, and</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c020'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Doomed as we are, our native dust,</div>
      <div class='line'>To meet with many a bitter shower,</div>
      <div class='line'>It ill befits us to disdain</div>
      <div class='line'>The altar, to deride the fane</div>
      <div class='line'>Where simple sufferers bend, in trust</div>
      <div class='line'>To win a happier hour.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>At the same time, it must be admitted
that there is a great deal of
confusion and contradiction in Chinese
ideas as to the state of the
dead. While they speak of the departed
spirit as still retaining a full
personality of its own, they also, or
at least many of them, believe in
the separation and return to the
primal elements of the various
spirits of which the human being is
composed. Thus the animal spirit,
for instance, would return to and
be lost in the great reservoir of
animal existence, just as a drop of
water in the ocean, and the mind or
intellect return to that of mind. Yet
their ideas on this subject, however
contradictory, and all their feelings,
point to death as not an evil in
itself, or an event to be dreaded.
Hence, in fact, their indifference to
life and extreme fondness for suicide.
Almost every Chinaman lives in the
spirit of their proverb, “The hero
does not ask if there be evil omens;
he views death as going home.”</p>

<p class='c009'>At Ma-hum I had a letter of introduction
to one of the elders, and
found that village small, much impoverished,
and greatly dilapidated.
Long warfare with Schan-tsun had
exhausted its resources; many habitations
were empty; the temple
and schoolhouse were in ruins;
there were very few women—some,
I fear, having been sold from distress—and
the people had a crushed,
desponding air. These clan-fights
in the south of China are rather
curious, and attention has not been
called to them. I never could
master all their intricacies, but they
occur sometimes between people of
different family names, and sometimes
between those of different
villages and districts. Two villages
having the same patronymic sometimes
fight, but most usually it is
the clanship which determines and
guides the quarrel. People of another
name visiting the parties are
very seldom interfered with, unless
it is by the hired combatants, who
are generally bad characters, and
are sometimes employed by wealthy
villages. At one place to which I
came, the elders sent out word they
would not allow us to enter, as they
had more than a thousand mercenary
soldiers there, and they could not
insure our safety. It is no unusual
thing for notice to be given when
a battle is to come off, and on these
occasions I have seen the hills
lined with hundreds of spectators
from other places, who entertained
no fears for their own safety, were
not interfered with, and applauded
both parties impartially according
to the valour or energy displayed.
I say energy, because at one of the
most vigorous fights I have seen
there was no enemy in sight, or
within several miles. Files of men
gathered in groups and stretched
into line; they ran down hills and
up hills again, waving huge flags;
they shook their spears, made ferocious
attacks upon an imaginary
foe, poured out volleys of abuse,
and now and then a single brave,
half naked, with a turban or napkin
round his head, would heroically
advance before his comrades,
throw himself into all sorts of impossible
postures, and indulge in a
terrific single combat; but though
all this was done, the opposite side
never made its appearance at all.
Another time I got up into a tree
close to two villages, about a couple
of hundred yards, from each other,
which were doing battle with gingalls.
The marksmen protected
themselves behind trees and walls
and the roofs of houses. Every
ten minutes or so, some one would
come out and show himself, making
derisive insulting gestures; on
which a shot or two was fired at
him, and the gingall-men on his
side tried in their turn to pick off
the marksmen. Before any one
was wounded, however, I had to
descend from the tree and beat a
retreat. These fights go on sometimes
for days and even weeks in
this way, without any more serious
loss on either side than a vast
expenditure of time, powder, and
bullets; but woe to the unfortunate
who happens to fall into the
hands of the opposite clan or village!
If his head is not taken off
at once, and his heart cut out,
which frequently happens, he may
perhaps be exchanged against some
prisoner; but it is just as likely
that he is put to death in a prolonged
and painful way, such as
being disjointed or sliced. When
a feud has gone on for some time,
when all attempts at mediation
have proved abortive, and great irritation
exists, then the combatants
usually come to closer quarters,
sometimes in the daytime, but more
usually at night. The stronger
side in such circumstances relaxes
its hostility, and tries to lull its opponents
into a feeling of false security.
When it has succeeded in
doing so, then a strong party will
make a sudden dash at the hostile
village during the daytime, and kill
and carry away as many persons as
it possibly can. More frequently,
however, a midnight attack is organised.
When the enemy are supposed
to feel themselves tolerably
secure, a vigorous attempt is made
to crush them altogether. Some
dark night the inhabitants of the
doomed village suddenly awake to
find themselves surrounded by armed
men who have scaled their walls,
and set fire to their houses by
throwing in among them a number
of blazing stink-pots, which also
confuse by their fumes and smoke.
Then rise to heaven the yell of
fury and the shriek of despair.
Quickly the fighting-men seize their
spears and gingalls, but, distracted
by the surprise and by their blazing
houses, they are soon shot, pinned
down with those terrible three-pronged
spears, or driven back into
the flames. Little or no mercy is
granted to them. Terrified women
seek to strangle their children, and
themselves commit suicide; but as
many of these as possible are saved,
in order that they may become servants
to the victors. Where the
golden evening saw a comfortable
village and happy families, the
grey dawn beholds desolation and
ashes, charred rafters and blackened
corpses.</p>

<p class='c009'>It may be asked whether the Government
exercises no control over
these local feuds; but in those districts
where they exist the mandarins
rarely interfere, except by
way of mediation and advice. Their
power is not so great that they can
afford to do more; and, besides, it
is not in accordance with Chinese
ideas that they should do so. Notwithstanding
its nominally despotic
form of government, China is really
one of the most self-governing
countries in the world. Each family,
village, district, and province is to
a very great extent expected to regulate
or “harmonise” itself. In order
to this end, great powers are allowed
within these limits. The father, or
the head of a family, can inflict
most serious and even very cruel
punishments on its members, without
his neighbours thinking they
have any right to interfere with
him; and, on the other hand, he is
held responsible for the misdeeds of
his children, and when these have
offended against public justice, and
are not to be got hold of, he often
suffers vicariously in their place.
In like manner, villages are allowed
great power in the settling of their
internal affairs through their elders.
Within certain wide limits the district
is left to preserve its own
peace, without troubling the higher
authorities of the province; and if
it choose to indulge in the expensive
luxury of clan-fights, why that
is its own loss. The mandarin of
Nam-taw, the capital of the district,
had told both the Ma-hum and
Schan-tsun people that they were
very foolish to go on fighting as
they were doing, and he had ordered
the latter, as the aggressors, to
desist, but there his interference
ended: there ought to be virtue
enough in the district to put down
such a state of matters, but there
was not; and by late news from
China it appears that the warlike
inhabitants of Schan-tsun have
been continuing and flourishing
in their career of violence; for
about a couple of months ago their
“young people”—the frolicsome
portion of the population—made a
night-attack upon the neighbouring
village of Sun-tsan, sacked every
house, carried off provisions, destroyed
the whole place except the
temple, and killed at random men,
women, and children to the number
of 150, no less than 75 of
the latter having been destroyed.
It is, in fact, this local weakness of
the Government which causes the
rebellions that devastate the country.
A gentleman thoroughly acquainted
with the language, writing to me
by last mail from the centre of
China, truly remarks on this subject:
“The causes of the rebellion
are, so far as I can see, the overpopulation
of the country, the inefficiency
of the mandarins, and
the indifference of the people. The
Chinese enjoy an amount of freedom
and self-government which, I
suppose, is nowhere surpassed, if
equalled; and their social system,
which is the result of so many
centuries’ experience of what human
life is, is sufficient to meet most of
their requirements. But it is not
sufficient to suppress the uprising of
the dangerous classes. To do this
the power of the country must
be organised into some sort of
shape, and then wielded with energy
and honesty. Unfortunately,
the present mandarins neither
have the one nor the other. But
the beginning of great changes in
China is at hand. I am convinced
that any attempt at foreign interference
in the civil government of
the provinces would do great mischief.”</p>

<p class='c009'>It will illustrate the sort of democratic
feeling which prevails in
China, to mention that the elder
with whom I stayed had Aheung
and my stranger chair-coolies as
well as myself to sit down at dinner
with him in the evening. The extreme
politeness of the Chinese
prevents this being disagreeable,
and I never saw the commonest
coolie either inclined to presume
upon such contact, or particularly
pleased by it. The German and
the Catholic missionaries have
their meals in this way when travelling,
and I found it, upon trial,
to be much the best. In its then
condition the resources of Ma-hum
were limited, and the house we
were in was a mere hovel of sun-dried
bricks; but our host produced
at dinner fresh and salt fish, pork
and turnip soup, boiled pork and
salted eggs, fine pork and small
white roots like potatoes, with cabbage,
bean-paste, and rice, apologising
for not having had warning
to prepare a better repast. When
unafflicted by famine or rebellion,
I should say that the labouring
Chinese live better than any other
people of the same class, except in
Australia and the United States.
Though they only take two meals
a day, yet they often refresh themselves
between with tea and sweet
cakes; and at these meals they
like to have several dishes, among
which both fish and pork are usually
to be found; often eggs, ducks, and
fowls; in some parts of the country
mutton, and in others beef. Their
cookery is also very good; I never
met anything very <em>outré</em> in it, except
on one single occasion, chips
of dog-ham, which were served out
as appetisers, and are very expensive,
and come from the province of
Shan-tung, where the animal is fed
up for the purpose upon grain. The
breeding of fish in ponds is one of
the most plentiful and satisfactory
sources for the supply of food in
China, and attempts are being
made at present to introduce it
into France. The great secret of
their cookery is that it spares fuel
and spares time. In most of their
dishes the materials are cut up into
small pieces before being placed
upon the fire, and some are even
cooked by being simply steamed
within the pan in which the invariable
rice is cooked. The rice tastes
much more savoury than that which
we get in this country, and is not
unpleasant to eat alone, steam
rather than water being used in
preparing it for the table—a sea
voyage exercising some damaging
effect upon its flavour. The great
drawback of the food of the lower
Celestials is that the vegetables are
often salt, and resemble sour kraut;
the pork is too fat, and the salt fish
is frequently in a state of decay.
Bean-paste also—a frequent article
among the poor—cannot be too
strongly condemned; nor is it redeemed
by the fact that it is in
much use among the holy men of
the Buddhist monasteries, for they
have a decided preference for “vegetables
of the sea.”</p>

<p class='c009'>At Ma-hum I got a small empty
cottage to sleep in, with only the
company of a <em>phoong quei</em>, or “wind
box,” used for preparing corn, and
exactly the same in construction
and appearance as the “fanners”
which used to be employed in
Scottish barns. My trip, so far as
it was by land, ended next day at
Nam-tow, the district capital, a
large walled town of, I should think,
not less than a hundred thousand
souls. This place had been bombarded
about eighteen months before
by our gunboats, in consequence
of the mandarins stopping
the supplies of Hong-Kong, and withdrawing
the native servants; so I
was rather afraid of being mobbed,
or otherwise ill-treated, if I delayed
in it, or turned on my footsteps
when looking for the passage-boat
to Hong-Kong. Even when there is
no positive danger, a Chinese mob
is rather trying to a solitary European;
but China is a civilised
country, and fortunately there were
two boats and competition. The
consequence of this was, that the
touter of one of them waylaid us
about a mile and a half from the
town, and led me direct to his junk,
in which I at once embarked, to
the disappointment of the crowd
which had begun to gather upon
our heels.</p>

<p class='c009'>I used to find it safer to go about
that part of the coast in passage-boats
rather than in one of my
own, and of course in that way saw
much more of the people. These
vessels usually go two and two in
company, in order to assist one another
against the not unfrequent
attacks of pirates; and are pretty
well armed with stink-pots, two or
three small cannon, and spears innumerable.
When not crowded
they do very well, and a small sum
procures the sole use of a small
matted cabin without any furniture,
if it is not pre-engaged. On this
occasion the extra cabin was occupied,
and in that of the supercargo,
which is also usually available, there
was a portion of his family; so I had
to content myself with the deck
and the “first-class” cabin, which
was occupied by shopkeepers and
small merchants. The Chinese are
not very clean, especially in cold
weather, when they put on coat
over coat without ever changing
the inner one: in the poorer houses
the dirt and water are not properly
“balanced,” and they have a saying
which associates “lice and good-luck;”
but, most fortunately for
travellers, their <em>pediculi</em>, like horses
in Japan, appear to participate in the
national antipathy for foreigners.
There were about fifty passengers
in this boat bound for Hong-Kong,
and the cargo consisted of vegetables
and sugar-cane. One little
boy on board appeared to have been
told off to do the cooking and religion.
He would suddenly stop in
his task of cutting up fish or turnips,
and burn a red joss-paper with
a prayer upon it, for the success
of our voyage; then as suddenly
utter an exclamation and dive down
again among the pots. This little
wretch of a cook, though chaffed
at by the sailors and afflicted by a
severe cold, appeared perfectly contented,
happy, and even joyful—which
may be a lesson to some
other doctors elsewhere. The Universe,
acting under the Chinese system,
had found a place which suited
him, work adapted to his nature,
and such small enjoyments as he
could appreciate. He always found
time, every five minutes, to snatch
a chew at sugar-cane, and even lost
five cash by gambling. In these
passage-boats the fare is not, and
cannot be expected to be, very good;
but our diminutive artist prepared
for dinner stewed oysters, fried and
boiled fish, fat pork, salt eggs, rice,
greens, turnips, and onions.</p>

<p class='c009'>The British sailor adorns his bunk
with a rude portrait of lovely Nancy,
but our junk had inscriptions savouring
of a lofty kind of poetry and
morality. In the cabin there was
written up in Chinese characters,
“The virtue which we receive from
Heaven is as great as a mountain;”
and also, “The favour (grace) received
from the Spirit of the Ocean
is as deep as the ocean itself.” On
the roof we were informed that
Heaven, and not only wood, was
above us, by the inscription, “The
virtue of the (divine) Spirit illuminates
everything.” These were intelligible,
but this one, which was
on the mainmast, requires interpretation—“There
is majesty on the
Eight Faces.” It must be understood
to mean that there is majesty,
or glory, everywhere around. The
paper on the rudder exclaimed—“Keep
us secure, Tai Shon!” or
“Great mountain,” a very holy and
“powerful” hill in Schan-tung, to
which Confucius has alluded, and
to which pilgrimages are made. At
the bows there was the cheering assurance,
“The ship’s head prospers,”
which in our passage was not
falsified.</p>

<p class='c009'>These evidences of high moral
feeling, however, were hardly borne
out by the conduct of the crew. As
‘Punch’s’ footman observed of the
leg-of-mutton dinner, they were
“substantial, but coarse;” quite
without the politeness of the peasantry;
friendly enough, but indulging
in rough play, such as giving
each other, and some of the
passengers, sundry violent pats on
the head. The captain, as is everywhere
usual at sea, gave his orders
roughly, and required them to be
promptly obeyed. They don’t think
much of firing into another boat, by
way of amusement or gentle warning;
and are not altogether averse
to a quiet little piece of piracy when
it comes in their way. On leaving
the Canton river the wind and tide
in the Kup-shui-moon pass or strait
were so strong that we ran in-shore,
anchored, and spent the night there.
Most of the crew and some of the
passengers sat up most of the night
gambling, which surely did not look
as if their virtue was quite the size
of a mountain, and indulged in some
violent disputes. Their playing-cards
were more elaborate than ours,
having many characters and devices
upon them, but not a fourth of the
size. Being scarcely half an inch
broad, though about the same length
as ours, and with more distinctive
marks, they were held and handled
with much greater ease. Instead of
being dealt out, they were laid down
on their faces between the players,
and each man helped himself in
order.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Kup-shui-moon is a great
place for pirates, and as I was
courting sleep some of the passengers
were discussing the probability
of our being taken by them, and
hung up by the thumbs and great
toes to make us send for an outrageous
ransom. They did not use
<em>Hai traák</em>, the Chinese word for
“sea-robbers,” but <em>Pi-long</em>, which
is a Chinesified form of the English
word “pirate,” and <em>La-lì-loong</em>,
which is doubtless their form of
the Portuguese word <i><span lang="pt">ladrone</span></i>. Like
the Italians with their <em>bifstecca</em> for
our abrupt “beefsteak,” the Chinese,
when they adopt or use European
words, throw them into an extended
mellifluous form, in which it is
difficult to recognise the original
sound. <em>La-lì-loong</em> is a good illustration
of this, and so also is
<em>pe-lan-dia</em>, by which they mean
“brandy.” The estuary of the
Pearl river and the neighbouring
coast have long been famous for
pirates, and the passengers were not
without some cause of apprehension.
I have seen these professional pirate
junks watching in the Kup-shui-moon
at one time, and only a few
mails ago there came out accounts
of an attempt to take an English
steamer in or close to it. Not less
than their names, <em>Pi-long</em> and <em>La-lì-loong</em>,
the pirates of China are a
result of foreign contact, and as yet
give no signs of diminishing either
in numbers or in power.</p>

<p class='c009'>However, no sea-robbers disturbed
our repose. Next morning I
found we had passed the strait, and
were drawing under the shadow of
Victoria Peak.</p>

  <h2 class='c002'>MARRIAGE BELLS.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>The British nation has just had
one of its grand spontaneous holidays—a
holiday so universal and
unanimous that imagination is at a
loss where to find that surprised
and admiring spectator whose supposed
presence heightens ordinary
festivities by giving the revellers a
welcome opportunity of explaining
what it is all about. There is not
a peasant nor a babe within the
three kingdoms which has not had
his or its share in the universal
celebration, and is not as well aware
as we are what the reason is, or why
every sleeper in England was roused
on this chill Tuesday morning by
the clangour of joy-bells and irregular
(alas! often thrice irregular)
dropping of the intermittent <i><span lang="fr">feu-de-joie</span></i>,
with which every band of
Volunteers in every village, not to
speak of great guns and formal
salutes, has vindicated its British
rights—every man for himself—to
honour the day. We are known as a
silent nation in most circumstances,
and a nation grave, sober-minded,
not enthusiastic; yet, barring
mountains and moors, there is
not a square mile of British soil
in any of the three kingdoms in
which the ringing of joyful bells,
the cheers of joyful voices, have
not been the predominating sound
from earliest dawn of this March
morning. Labour has suspended
every exertion but that emulation
of who shall shout the loudest and
rejoice the most heartily. If there
was any compulsion in the holiday,
it was a pressure used by the people
upon a Government which has other
things to do than invent or embellish
festivals. We have insisted
upon our day’s pleasuring. We
have borne all the necessary expenses,
and taken all the inevitable
trouble. Is it sympathy, loyalty,
national pride? or what is it?
It is something embracing all, yet
more simple, more comprehensive,
more spontaneous than either: it is
a real personal joy which we have
been celebrating—the first great
personal event in the young life
which belongs to us, and which we
delight to honour. The Son of
England receives his bride in the
sight of no limited company, however
distinguished, but of the entire
nation, which rejoices with him and
over him without a dissentient or
discontented voice. Our sentiments
towards him are of no secondary
description. It is our wedding, and
this great nation is his father’s
house.</p>

<p class='c009'>His father’s house—not now is
the time to enlarge upon these
words, nor the suggestions of most
tender sadness, the subduing Lenten
shadow upon the general joy which
they convey, and which is in everybody’s
mind. It is the house of
his Mother whom her people have
come to serve, not with ordinary
tributes of loyalty, but with intuitions
of love. England has learned
to know, not what custom exacts
or duty requires towards her Royal
Mistress, but, with a certain tender
devotion which perhaps a nation
can bear only to a woman, to follow
the thoughts, the wishes, the inclinations
of <span class='sc'>her Queen</span>. Something
has come to pass of which
constitutional monarchy, popular
freedom, just laws, offer no sufficient
explanation. The country is
at one with the Sovereign. A
union so perfect has come about by
degrees, as was natural; and the
heart of the race which expanded
to her in natural sympathy, when,
young and inexperienced, she ascended
the throne, has quickened gradually
into a warmer universal sentiment
than perhaps has ever been
felt for a monarch. We use the
ancient hyperboles of loyalty with
calmness in this island, knowing
that they rather fall short of the
fact than exceed it. It is barely
truth to say that any trouble or
distress of Hers affects her humble
subjects in a degree only less acute
than their own personal afflictions;
and that never neighbour was wept
over with a truer heart in the day
of her calamity than was the Queen
in hers by every soul of her subjects,
great and small. Intense
sorrow cannot dwell long in the
universal bosom; but the country,
not contented with rendering its
fullest tribute of grief for the lost,
has dedicated many an occasional
outbreak of tears through all these
months to that unaccustomed cloud
which veiled the royal house. And
now it is spring, and the purest abstract
type of joy—young love and
marriage—comes with strange yet
sweet significance in Lent, to open,
as we all hope, a new chapter in that
household history in which we are
so much concerned. With all the
natural force of revulsion out of
mourning, with all the natural sympathy
for that visible representation
of happiness in which men and
women can never refuse to be interested,
there has mingled, above
all, a wistful national longing “to
please the Queen.” Curiosity and
interest were doubtless strongly excited
by the coming of the bride—but
not for the fair Danish Princess
alone would London have built
itself anew in walls of human faces,
and an entire community expended
a day of its most valuable time for
one momentary glimpse of the
sweet girlish countenance on which
life as yet has had time to write
nothing but hope and beauty. The
sentiment of that wonderful reception
was but a subtle echo of our
Lady’s wish, lovingly carried out by
the nation, which is her Knight as
well as Subject. To hide our dingy
London houses, we could not resort
to the effective tricks with which
skilful French hands can make impromptu
marble and gold: but we
did what art and genius could never
attempt to do—what nothing but
love could accomplish; we draped
and festooned and clustered over
every shabby line of architecture
with a living illumination of English
faces, all glowing and eager
not only to see the new-comer,
but to show the new-comer, what no
words could ever tell her, that she
came welcome as a daughter to that
heart of England in which, without
any doubt or controversy, the
Mother-Monarch held a place more
absolute than could be conquered
by might or won by fame. Let us
not attempt to read moral lessons
to the princely lovers, who, it is to
be hoped, were thinking of something
else than moralities in that
moment of their meeting, and were
for the time inaccessible to instruction;
but without any moral meaning,
the sentiment which swayed
the enthusiastic multitude on the
day of the Princess Alexandra’s
arrival was more like that of a vast
household, acting upon the personal
wish of its head, than a national
demonstration coldly planned by
official hands. The Queen, who sat
at her palace window in the soft-falling
twilight, looking out like
any tender mother for the coming
of her son and his bride, till the
darkness hid her from the spectators
outside, gave the last climax of
truth and tenderness to that welcome,
which was no affair of ceremony,
but a genuine universal utterance
of the unanimous heart.</p>

<p class='c009'>Loyalty seems an inherent quality
in our race; but it has been a
loyalty of sections up to the present
time, whenever it has been at all
fervent or passionate. It has been
reserved for Queen Victoria to make
of it a sentiment as warm as in
days of tumult, as broad as in times
of peace. So thoroughly has she
conquered the heart of the nation,
that it seems about time to give
up explaining why. To those who
have been born under her rule,
and even to her own contemporaries,
a pure Court and a spotless
royal life appear no exceptional
glories, but the natural and blessed
order of things; and we love
her, not consciously because of
her goodness, but only for love’s
own royal reason, because we love
her. Nothing can happen of any
moment in those royal rooms where
so very small a number of her people
can ever dream of entering as
guests, without moving the entire
mass of her people with a sentiment
only second, as we have already
said, to immediate personal
joy or grief. It is this alone that
can explain the extraordinary rejoicings
of this day. We keep the
feast not by sympathy in another’s
joy, but by positive appropriation
of a joy which is our own. The
wedding has, in fact, been celebrated
in the presence of all England,
with unanimous consent and
acclamation of the same. With
blessings and tears, with immeasurable
good wishes, hopes, and joyful
auguries, we have waited at the
princely gates to send the Bride and
Bridegroom upon their way. Speak
it in audible words, oh Princes and
Poets! Echo it in mighty tones
of power, oh awful cannons and
voices of war, which deal no death
in England,—sound it forth over
all the world and space in inarticulate
murmurous thunders, oh unanimous
People! Let the Mother
smile among her tears to hear how
every faithful soul of her true subjects
honours her children; and
then let there be silence in the
midst of all—silence one moment,
and no more, for the missing Voice
which would have made the joy
too perfect—</p>

      <div class='line in2'>“Nor count me all to blame, if I</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Conjecture of a stiller guest,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Perchance, perchance among the rest,</div>
      <div class='line'>And though in silence wishing joy.”</div>

<p class='c009'>And now the thing we wish for
most to complete our rejoicing is, if
we could but have some spectator
worthy the sight, to see all our great
towns blazing up to heaven, and
every village glimmering over “beneath
its little lot of stars,” with all
the lights it can gather. A group
of sympathetic angels fanning the
solemn airs of night with grand expanded
wing and flowing garments,
watching the great and strange
marvel of a nation wild with joy,
would be pleasant to think of at
this moment. Perhaps to such
watchers, lingering on cloudy mountain
heights above us, the hamlets
shining like so many glow-worms
all over the dewy darkling country
would be the sweetest sight. London,
glowing in a lurid blaze into
the night, doing all that is in her
to give splendour to the darkness;
Edinburgh, more gloriously resplendent,
with valleys and hills of fire,
improvising a drama of illumination
with lyric responses and choral
outbursts of sweet light, the emblem
of joy, are but the centres of the
scene. Here, too, past our village
windows, comes the blaze of torches,
held high in unseen hands, moving
in a picturesque uncertain line between
the silent bewildered trees:
though nobody wits of us, hidden
in the night, that is no reason why
we should stifle the joy in our
hearts on this night of the wedding.
Windsor itself did not begin
to thrill with bells earlier than we;
and even Edinburgh will have commenced
to fade slowly out of the
enchanted air into the common
slumber ere we have exhausted all
those devious rockets which startle
the darkness and the dews. Nor
we only, but every congregation of
cottages, every cluster of humble
roofs, wherever a church-spire penetrates
the air, wherever there is
window to light or bell to ring.
Bear us witness, dear wondering
angels! Far off by the silent inland
rivers, deep under the shadows
of the hills, perched upon rocky
points and coves by the sea, lying
low upon the dewy plains, is there
a village over all the island that has
not lighted a joyous blaze for love
of its Queen, and in honour of the
Bride? Health, joy, prosperity, and
increase to our Prince and Princess!
If they can ever be happier than
at this sweet moment, crowned
by Love and Youth with that joy
which human imagination has
everywhere concluded the height
of human blessedness, let the
heavens advance them speedily to
yet a sweeter glory. If there were
any better bliss we could win for
them or purchase for them, the
world well knows we would spare
no pains; but as it is, all that loyal
hearts can do is to wish, with hearty
love and acclaim, every joy short of
heaven to the young heirs of all
our hopes; but not that for many
a happy year.</p>

<p class='c009'>And now the holiday is over,
and the stars begin to show softly
over the waning lights and voices
fatigued with joy. Is there, perhaps,
a Watcher in the royal chambers
who weeps in the night when
all is over, and God alone sees Her
solitude—Our Queen! There is not
a woman in England but thinks of
you—not a man but would purchase
comfort for your heart by any deed
that man could do. Since the marriage-feast
was spread for <em>you</em>, Liege
Lady and Sovereign, what have not
Life and Time done for all of us—what
happiness, what anguish,
what births and deaths! Now is it
over, the joy of life?—but still remain
tender love and honour, dear
duty and labour, God and the children,
the heirs of a new life. Oh,
tranquil heavens! stoop softly over
the widowed and the wedded—over
us who have had, and they who
have, the perfection and the joy!
Enough for all of us, that over all
is the Common Father, whose love
can accomplish nothing which is
not Well.</p>
